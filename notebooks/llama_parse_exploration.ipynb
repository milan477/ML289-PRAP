Alisal St / Church St where I assumed the number one position in the pursuit and Sergeant Roman was in the number two position.

      "When we reached the area of Alameda Dr and E Romie Lane Sergeant Roman passed me on the right-hand side and attempted the Pursuit intervention technique and temporarily immobilized Ayon's vehicle. After the PIT maneuver Ayon's vehicle ended up facing in a W/B direction on the west curb line on Alameda Ave in the driveway of 339 E. Romie Ln. Ayon then put the vehicle into drive and tried to go around my patrol car, but I pulled forward and forced his vehicle to go back into the driveway as he attempted to go through the sidewalk but was blocked partially by my patrol car and a fixed light pole. At this time Sergeant Roman pulled his vehicle directly behind Avon and Ayon backed into him. Ayon pulled forward and created space between Sergeant Roman's patrol car. Sergeant Roman and I exited our patrol cars and challenged Ayon at gun point. Ayon then accelerated in reverse as Sergeant Roman was getting back into his vehicle and rammed Sergeant Roman. Sergeant Roman was able to push Ayon's vehicle with his patrol car onto a tree causing the front tires to be off the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "I exited my patrol car and once again challenged Ayon to put his hands up. Ayon refused to put his hands up and started to press on the accelerator and manipulate the gear shifter. I could see the front tires spinning as Ayon was pressing on the accelerator and was also moving the steering wheel left and right as if he was trying to disengage the vehicle from the tree. Ayon continually reached under the seat to the vehicle on both sides. The vehicle was resting on top of a tree at an angle which also made it difficult to see Ayon's hands. Officers kept challenging Ayon to put his hands up however he refused and kept reaching under the seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officer J. Munoz arrived on scene and had broken right front passenger window out with a 40mm round. Ayon still refused to put his hands up and Officer Munoz broke right rear passenger window as well in attempts to find a way into the vehicle to deploy K-9 Bolt. Detective Scaggs, who was also on scene, gave Ayon a K9 announcement however he refused to comply with commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "K-9 Bolt was used for the following reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "The suspect was actively resisting arrest and evading officers. Based on the fact that Ayon had demonstrated his willingness to endanger the lives of the public and the responding officers showing no regard for the safety of others and that Ayon was an unsearched felony suspect who had committed a serious offense, I deployed K-9 Bolt into the vehicle to apprehend Ayon.\n",

      "The use of the K-9 Bolt was the less than lethal force option. After K-9 Bolt was in the vehicle he apprehended Ayon by biting him on the right upper arm. I approached the vehicle from the passenger side and due to the fact that the vehicle was inclined I could not enter the vehicle from the passenger side. I ran around the vehicle and made my way to the driver's side door. I had to push the back sliding door open to get into the vehicle. I instructed the Officers that were assisting me to pull Ayon out of the vehicle. Once Ayon was taken out of the vehicle I gave K-9 Bolt the release command and he released from the bite.\n",

      "When I contacted Ayon at the hospital, I advised him of his Miranda rights and the following is a summary of his statement: I asked Ayon why he didn't stop for that patrol cars that were pursing him because he was afraid of the police because they had originally tried to take him out of the car in Marina. Ayon said that the Marina cops have been dicks to him in the past and today they pointed a gun at him to get him out of the car therefore he fled from them. Ayon said that when he was on highway 68 the officers had stopped chasing him and he pulled into the Toro Park residential area. Ayon said when he drove out of the Toro Park residential area CHP had started to pursue him again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked Ayon if he saw the line of patrol cars behind him and he said that he didn't because the mirror was not in the right position. I told Ayon that I had tried to PIT his vehicle several times however he kept braking and then accelerating. I asked Ayon where he was driving to, and Ayon responded and said that he didn't have a plan and was going to continue driving until officers stopped chasing him. I asked after his vehicle was PIT why did he continue to attempt to escape. Ayon said that he didn't know what he was thinking, and he was sorry that he made a stupid mistake. I asked Ayon why he kept reaching under the seats when officers were challenging him to put his hands up. Ayon said that he was trying to gather all of his money and put it all in his wallet because it was his life savings. I told Ayon that I even gestured to him with my hands up and see if would put his hands up and he refused. Ayon asked me what his charges and I were gave them to him and he said that he was sorry and he made a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I confronted Ayon about a large number of blue pills with an imprint of M30 on it. I asked Ayon if they were M30 pills and he said that they were. Ayon said that everything illegal in the vehicle belonged to him.\n",

      "Before my arrival, the Officer informed County Communications that Ayon had rammed his vehicle into the Officer's vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following is a summary of my involvement. See my BWC for further details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon arrival, I observed that Ayon's Honda Odyssey was pushed onto a small tree, and a fully marked police vehicle was behind it. I pulled out my gun and observed Ayon reaching under his seat and looking for what I thought was a gun. Surrounding Officers had their guns out, pointed at Ayon, and ordered him repeatedly to put his hands up. Ayon continued to look and reach around the cab of his vehicle and did not comply with orders to put his hands up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I de-escalated and holstered my gun and pulled out my department-issued 40mm foam munition. I fired two rounds at the front passenger window, and the projectiles bounced off the window. The third round shattered the front window. I shot the fourth and final round at the passenger rear window, which shattered. Ayon still did not comply and was attempting to move his vehicle. He had it in gear, and the front wheels were spinning as he tried to drive his vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "This concluded my part in this investigation, and for further details, see my BWC.\n",

At approximately 1426 hours, Monterey County Dispatch advised me of C.H.P.'s involvement in a pursuit and requested a K-9 officer. The want on the suspect was assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer. K-9 Officer Anthony Garcia was about to start since Second Watch was at the station. I and K-9 Officer Garcia responded from the police station Code 3 towards the pursuit.\n",

      "At approximately 1433 hours, we caught up to the pursuit at E. Alisal St and Homestead Ave. The suspect vehicle, a silver Honda Odyssey, CA plate # , was traveling eastbound on E. Alisal St. with three CHP units pursuing the vehicle. The suspect vehicle ran a red light at the intersection. I and Officer Garcia began to trail the pursuit, At E. Alisal St. and Riker Ave. CHP requested us to take over the pursuit. Officer Garcia is PIT-trained and informed me he would attempt a P.I.T. maneuver on the vehicle.

The suspect kept zig-zagging and would drive on the opposite side of the roadway to prevent Officer Garcia from conducting the P.I.T. maneuver. I observed in the area of Pajaro St., at least once, the suspect vehicle went into the opposite lane, and a vehicle was coming from the opposite direction. That vehicle pulled to the curb to get out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we were traveling southbound on Alameda Ave. I knew if we continued straight, we were going to go into a school zone. I am currently trained and certified in the Pursuit intervention technique with the Salinas Police Department. At Alameda Ave. and Hawthorne St. Officer Garcia attempted to P.I.T. the vehicle, and the suspect slammed his brakes, reducing his speed considerably. Officer Garcia had also slowed down as well. The suspect took off again, and since I hadn't slowed down yet, I accelerated, which helped me catch up to the suspect vehicle and placed my S.U.V. in a position to conduct the P.I.T. maneuver. I placed my front push bumper on the right rear wheel well area, and I successfully P.I.T. the suspect vehicle into the driveway of 339 E. Romie Lane.\n",
      "\n",
      "The driveway to the residence faced Alameda Ave. The suspect vehicle came to rest on a Toyota Corolla parked just north of the driveway, causing minor damage to the vehicle's left rear taillight and bumper area. I drove past the suspect vehicle, and I noticed there was a large gap behind the suspect vehicle. I repositioned my S.U.V. to place my push bumper on the rear bumper of the suspect vehicle to prevent his escape. As I did this, the suspect vehicle was in reverse and struck my push bumper. Both Officer Garcia and I exited our vehicles and were yelling commands. I observed the suspect vehicle start moving forward. I could see he had turned his wheels right, and I thought he was trying to drive past a lamp pole on the sidewalk to get away from us. I jumped back into my S.U.V., at which point I noticed that the suspect vehicle was in reverse and purposely rammed my vehicle. I observed Officer Garcia standing to my right side by his patrol vehicle, and the suspect was trying to turn in that direction. I felt that he was going to ram or strike Officer Garcia with his vehicle in his attempt to escape. I placed my SUV in drive and used the push bumper to push the van forward into a lemon tree directly in front of the suspect vehicle. This caused the van's front end to lift up, and due to it being front-wheel drive, the front two tires no longer had contact with the ground and had no traction.\n",

I could see that he was moving around, and it appeared he was trying to conceal something on his person or near the area where he was seated. I could see both using his driver-side mirror and through the rear window. I noticed that, at one point, he was moving the driver-side mirror to see where I was at. I also observed that he was still trying to move the suspect vehicle. I could see and hear him accelerating the suspect vehicle, which caused the tires to spin.

A fourth 40mm less lethal round broke the rear passenger window. As officers arrived, I informed them that the 40mm launcher was being used due to the sound sounding like gunfire and not wanting officers to confuse it with gunfire.\n",

      "After the windows were broken, Officer Garcia placed K-9 Bolt in the vehicle. Initially, Officer Garcia, Officer Skaggs, Officer R. Miller, and Officer Munoz approached the vehicle's right passenger side. Officer Garcia attempted to open the vehicle's sliding door, but it was jammed. Officer Garcia, Officer Urquizo, and Detective Skaggs repositioned to the left side of the suspect vehicle. I approached them as they were having difficulty removing the suspect from the vehicle.

I placed my knee between his shoulders so officers could cuff him.\n",
