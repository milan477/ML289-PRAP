Lieutenant Conaty informed me there had been an officer involved shooting \nin the city of Antioch, which involved four actor officers, and several witnessing officers.  \nLieutenant Conaty advised the suspect had been transported to the hospital and was in critical \ncondition.   \n \nAt approximately 1000 hours, I arrived at the Antioch Police Department.  Upon arrival, I met \nwith additional Inspectors from the District Attorney's Office, and Detectives from the Antioch \nPolice Department.     \n \nAt approximately 1200 hours, I attended a briefing conducted by Antioch Police Detective \nSergeant Colley regarding the shooting and what led up to it.  During the briefing, I learned the \nfollowing information:   \n \nOn Thursday, September 26, 2023, at approximately 1418 hours, Community Service \nOfficer Graham responded to the Cube Smart Self Storage located at 1790 Vineyard \nDrive in the city of Antioch.

At this time, CSO Graham \nreviewed surveillance footage of the vehicle theft, which occurred earlier the same day.  \nWhile reviewing the surveillance footage, CSO Graham saw that on Thursday, September \n26, 2023, at approximately 0130 hours, two unknown male subjects were walking \naround inside the storage yard.  At approximately 0152 hours, a blue or purple panel van \nis seen entering the storage yard via the rear gate, located at the end of Vineyard Drive.  \nThe panel van then can be seen pushing a white 1987 Chevrolet Monte Carlo (Cal. \nLicense Plate #\n) out of the south gate of the storage yard onto E. 18th Street.  \nOnce the panel van and the Monte Carlo exited the south gate, CSO Graham was unable \nto see them because it was out of the surveillance camera's view.   \n \nadvised that nobody had permission to be at the storage yard, at that \ntime.   \nthen provided CSO Graham with the owner of the Monte Carlo \npersonal information.  CSO Graham made telephone contact with the owner of the \nMonte Carlo, (\n who currently resides in Florida, and he advised that he \ndid not give anyone permission to have his vehicle.  CSO Graham completed a stolen \nvehicle report, and requested the surveillance footage of the incident from Cube Smart \nSelf Storage, as evidence of the theft.  CSO Graham later entered the stolen Monte Carlo \ninto the Stolen Vehicle System (SVS) and returned to his duties.   \n \nOn Sunday, October 1, 2023, at approximately 0741 hours, CSO Graham was conducting \nhis patrol duties, when he noticed a white Chevrolet Monte Carlo backed into the \ncarport of \n  The Monte Carlo was covered with a tarp.  CSO \nGraham noticed a blue panel van backed into the carport next to the Monte Carlo.  CSO \nGraham believed the blue panel van was similar to the one he saw involved with the \ntheft of the Monte Carlo on Thursday, September 26, 2023.  Based on this, CSO Graham \ncontacted dispatch, and requested assistance from patrol.  K-9 Officer Marques \nresponded to assist CSO Graham, as did Officer Dibble, Officer Mulholland, and his \nTrainee Officer Posey.   \n \nOfficer Marques arrived on the scene followed by Officer Dibble.

As Officer Marques did this, he noticed someone (later \nidentified as suspect Daniel Mackin) was sleeping in the rear cargo area of the vehicle \nwith a handgun lying next to him in plain view.   \n \nOfficer Marques advised dispatch of this observation, and the officers quickly backed \naway from the suspect vehicle and took cover near their patrol vehicles.

Officers Borg and \nOfficer Armstrong arrived on the scene and took a position near Officer Marques' patrol \nvehicle.  \n \nAt this time, Mackin got into the driver's seat of the van and started it.  Mackin then \nattempted to flee, by driving the van through the apartment building's parking lot over a \ncurb/green belt area, and onto A Street.  The van then hit a utility box, and a street sign \npole, at which time it became stuck.  Officers continued to give Mackin orders to come \nout of the van, but Mackin refused.  Mackin began to back up and drive forward several \ntimes, in an attempt to free the van and escape.  At this time, Officer Mulholland utilized \na 40mm less lethal weapon to break out the driver's side window of the van.  After four \nunsuccessful attempts to break the van's driver's side window, Mackin fled on foot out \nthe side cargo doors of the van.   \n \nAs Mackin fled from the van he was holding something in his waistband or hooded \nsweatshirt front pocket with his left hand.  As Mackin fled eastbound on A Street, Officer \nMarques deployed his police K-9 to apprehend him.  As Mackin fled he was followed by \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n15 \na small dog that had been inside the van.  The small dog distracted the police K-9, which \nprevented the K-9 from apprehending Mackin.  As Mackin ran, the officers could now \nsee a chrome handgun in his right hand.   \n \nAs Mackin continued to run east, he turned several times toward the police officers \npursuing him, and was now pointing the handgun in their direction.  The pursuing \nofficers, then fired several times at Mackin as he fled.  At one point Mackin fell to the \nground and came to rest in a seated position on the north curbline, still pointing the \nhandgun at the officers.  Officers then fired additional shots at Mackin as he got to his \nfeet, still pointing the handgun in the direction of pursuing officers.  Mackin continued to \nrun eastbound on A Street, with the handgun in his right hand.  As Mackin ran, he threw \nthe handgun, over his head in a northern direction.  The handgun landed on the north \nsidewalk of A Street, where it was later recovered fully, loaded with six live rounds.   \n \nOnce the handgun was discarded, officers verbally announced Mackin had discarded it, \nand no other shots were fired.  Mackin ran approximately another 10-15 yards until he \ncame to a stop, went to his knees, and laid down on the ground in the middle of A \nstreet.  Officers approached Mackin who had sustained one through and through \ngunshot wound to his torso.  Mackin was immediately handcuffed, and emergency \nmedical personnel were requested.  Officers obtained a medical kit from a patrol vehicle, \nand began administering first aid.  Fire and ambulance personnel arrived and Mackin \nwas transported to John Muir Hospital, Walnut Creek Campus.  Per medical staff at John \nMuir Hospital, Mackin had sustained injuries to both lungs as a result of being shot.  \nMackin was intubated and was being treated for his injuries.   \n \nAfter Sergeant Colley's briefing, we reviewed the body-worn camera footage of the involved \nofficers.

The scene was cordoned off by crime scene tape, and Antioch Police \npersonnel were providing scene security and maintaining a crime scene log.  The Contra Costa \nCrime Lab, Contra Costa District Attorney's Office, and Antioch PD Crime Scene Investigators \nwere also on the scene conducting their duties.  I could see the blue van Mackin attempted to \nflee in, had struck a utility box and a street sign pole from driving over the curbed parking lot \nand into the vegetation between the parking lot and A Street.  In an easterly direction on A \nStreet, I could see several crime scene plaques marking numerous expended shell casings.   \nFurther east on the north sidewalk of A Street, I saw another crime scene plaque that marked a \nchrome revolver.  A short distance further east was clothing and blood in the middle of the \nstreet.   \n \n is a three story apartment complex comprised of the first floor being eight \nstorage units and a carport.  The second and third floors consist of four, two bedroom \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n18 \napartments on each floor.  The apartments all face north with a common parking lot that is \naccessible from a W. 3rd Street entry/exit point.  \n \nAfter assessing the crime scene, Detective Duffy and I responded back to the Antioch Police \nDepartment.  Upon our arrival, we were advised that the actor officers were not going to \nprovide statements that day, and those interviews were scheduled for Tuesday, October 3, 2023, \nat 1000 hours, at the Antioch Police Department.   \n \nIn preparation for the interviews of the officers, Detective Duffy and I conducted a further \nreview of the body-worn camera footage of the incident.  This was done in an attempt to \ndetermine when the last shot was fired, relative to when Mackin discarded the handgun.  At \n08:05:51 hours the last shot was fired and at 08:05:54 hours, Mackin discards the handgun.  \nThis was confirmed by the Antioch Police Department's shot spotter system and the officers' \nbody-worn cameras.   \n \nOn Tuesday, October 3, 2023, at 1011 hours, Detective Duffy and I met with Officer Armstrong \nand his attorney, Michael Rains of Rains, Lucia, Stern, St. Phalle & Silver, PC.  We met in the \nsecond floor conference room of the administrative wing of the Antioch Police Department.  \nThis interview was digitally recorded with Officer Armstrong's knowledge.  After introducing \nourselves, I initiated the interview by explaining to Officer Armstrong that the purpose of the \ninterview was to determine the facts and circumstances that surround this incident.   \n \nI also told Officer Armstrong this was a voluntary statement, and that he could stop at any time \nif he needed to take a break or speak with his attorney.  Officer Armstrong told me he \nunderstood.  I then asked Officer Armstrong to tell me about his background, including his \ntraining and experience.  Officer Armstrong in substance told us the following:  \n \nOfficer Kyle Armstrong Training and Experience:  \nHe attended the basic police academy and was hired by the Antioch Police Department.  \nHe has been in orientation training for approximately a week, and Sunday, October 1, \n2023, was his first day on patrol.  He spent 10 years in the military, and reached the rank \nof Sergeant in the U.S. Army, in a communications unit.  He deployed once to \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n19 \nAfghanistan and once to Somalia.  He does not have any prior law enforcement \nexperience and has a high school diploma and some college; however, he does not have \na degree.   \n \nAfter Officer Armstrong provided his training and experience, I asked him to explain what \nhappened that led to the officer involved shooting.  Officer Armstrong in substance told us the \nfollowing:  \n \nOfficer Kyle Armstrong Statement:  \nSunday, October 1, 2023, was his first day in the field training program.  He works from \n0630 hours until 1900 hours, which is a red day's schedule.  He had a good night's sleep \nand was well rested and ready for his day.  He was dressed in the Antioch Police \nUniform, with visible A.P.D. patches on his shoulders and an embroidered badge as well \nas a duty belt with his department issued firearm.  His firearm is a 9mm, Glock 17, Gen 5 \ndepartment issued handgun, which can carry a standard 17-round magazine plus one \nadditional round in the chamber.  He was loaded with 16 rounds in the magazine and \none in the chamber.  He also had two additional magazines with him.  One had 16 \nrounds and the other had 17 rounds.  He was short 2 rounds of duty ammunition, \nbecause while he was at the range the week before he dropped two rounds on the \nground and never found them.  He was wearing a department issued body camera, \nwhich was activated during this incident.    \n \nHe attended a briefing with his Training Officer, Officer Borg.  After the briefing, they \ncollected paperwork he would need in preparation for his day.  As they did this, there \nwas a call over the police radio of a subject sleeping in a vehicle with a firearm in his \nhand.  Officer Borg told him they were going to respond to the call, so they headed to \ntheir fully marked A.P.D. patrol vehicle.  Once at their patrol vehicle, they responded to \nthe detail.  As they responded, Officer Borg had him read the details of the call from the \ncomputer (Mobil Data Terminal, M.D.T.).  The details of this call were that officers had \nlocated a possible stolen vehicle, and next to the vehicle a subject was sleeping in a van \nwith a firearm in his lap.   \n \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n20 \nThey drove down 2nd Street to respond to the call, and did not turn on any emergency \nlights or siren to get there.  Upon arrival, they parked their patrol vehicle, and he could \nsee Training Officer Mulholland and his trainee, Officer Posey.  He also saw Officer \nDibble and K9 Officer Marques.  He could see two patrol vehicles facing a blue panel van \nwith their overhead emergency lights on.  He also could see officers pointing their \nfirearms at the van and giving commands to a subject inside the van (later identified as \nDaniel Mackin).   He and Officer Borg drew their firearms, and took a position to assist.   \n \nHe could not see anyone in the van at this time; however, he was told Mackin was in the \nback of the van, and he could see some movement inside.  There was a curtain between \nthe front compartment of the van and the cargo area in the back, which prevented him \nfrom clearly seeing into the van.  From this vantage point, he could see the curtains \ndividing the front and the back of the van shift as if someone had crawled underneath \nthem to move to the front of the cabin.  Suddenly he could see Mackin in the driver's \nseat, as the van's engine started.     \n \nNumerous commands were given to Mackin to get out of the van; however, Mackin did \nnot comply.  Mackin put the van in drive, and started to pull out of the parking stall he \nwas backed into.  Mackin attempted to drive over the curb bordering the parking lot and \nonto A Street; however, the van became stuck or high-sided in the vegetation between \nthe parking lot and A Street.  Mackin also hit a utility box and a street sign pole with the \nfront of the van.   \n \nAt this point, Officer Borg ran back to their patrol vehicle and turned it around.  Officer \nBorg positioned the vehicle facing northbound on 3rd Street in the event Mackin was \nable to drive away and a vehicle pursuit ensued.  Officers continued to give Mackin \nverbal commands to surrender.  He noticed that K9 Officer Marques had retrieved his K9 \nfrom his patrol vehicle.  At this point, they all had taken cover near their patrol vehicles \nin the area behind the van.  Officer Mulholland utilized a 40mm less lethal gun in an \nattempt to break out the driver's side window of the van.  This was not effective as the \nrubber rounds ricocheted off the van.  Officer Mulholland continued to fire several \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n21 \nrounds at the van, but he was uncertain how many.  The rounds just kept ricocheting off \nthe van, which he believed was due to the angle Officer Mulholland was firing from.   \n \nHe could see Mackin moved out of the driver's compartment area and back into the rear \ncargo area of the van.  He could no longer see Mackin, and they were aware he was still \nin possession of the handgun.  Officer Mulholland ran out of ammunition for the 40mm, \nso Mulholland moved to another vehicle to retrieve more.  During this time, Mackin \ncontinued to try and free the van by backing up and driving forward.  The tires of the van \nwere just spinning, and he was unable to free the van.  Officer Borg requested Officer \nMulholland attempt to shoot out the back window of the van with the 40mm less lethal \nweapon.  As Officer Mulholland was repositioning himself to take a shot with the 40mm, \nthe right side cargo door of the van opened and Mackin stepped out of the van.  Officer \nBorg and Officer Mulholland both gave Mackin commands to get down on the ground, \nbut he did not comply.   \n \nMackin pulled the hood of his hooded sweatshirt up over his head.  As Mackin did this, \nhe had a small dog in the van with him that jumped out as well.  Mackin looked like he \nwas holding the handgun in his front sweatshirt pocket with his left hand as he began to \nflee eastbound on A Street.  He could see what appeared to be the handle of the \nhandgun sticking out of the sweatshirt pocket.  K9 Officer Marques deployed his K9 and \nbegan to pursue Mackin.  He and Officer Borg both gave chase as well.  As they pursued \nMackin, Officer Marques, and Officer Borg were to his left.  He was not sure where \nOfficer Mulholland, Officer Dibble, or Officer Posey were exactly; however, he knew they \nwere somewhere around him.   \n \nAs Mackin fled on foot, Mackin fell near a light pole.  When Mackin fell to the ground, \nMackin took a seated position along the curb line.  He could now see Mackin holding the \nsilver or chrome firearm in his right hand and pointing it in the direction of Officer \nMarques and Officer Borg.  He could not tell if the handgun was a revolver or a semi-\nautomatic.  He could only see the barrel of the handgun.  He feared for the lives of his \nfellow officers, at which time he felt deadly force was necessary.  He then heard a shot \nfired by one of the officers near him, possibly to his left.  He then stopped running, took \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n22 \naim, and fired approximately 2 rounds at Mackin.  He estimated he was approximately \n20 to 25 feet away from Mackin when he fired his first shots.   \n \nAt this time, he heard several rounds being fired by his fellow officers to his left.  \nHowever, Mackin did not appear to be hurt or hit, at which time Mackin got back up and \ncontinued running eastbound on A Street.  As Mackin was fleeing eastbound, Mackin \ncontinually turned, looking back at the officers pursuing him.  He wasn't sure if Mackin \nwas turning to shoot at them while fleeing, so each time Mackin turned towards them \nwith the handgun in his hand, he and the other officers would fire at Mackin.  He fired \napproximately 6 more rounds at Mackin and each time he fired, he reassessed the \nsituation.    \n \nAs Mackin fled, Mackin did what he described as a \"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar hook shot\" \nand threw the handgun with his right hand over his head in a northern direction.  Once \nMackin discarded the handgun, he yelled out to everyone, \"he dropped the gun.\"  Once \nhe yelled out that Mackin no longer had the handgun in his possession, no other shots \nwere fired.  It was unclear if Mackin was merely discarding the handgun or trying to \nthrow it into the adjacent river.   The handgun came to rest on the north sidewalk of A \nStreet.  Moments later, Mackin collapsed and fell to the ground where he was \nhandcuffed and taken into custody.  Once Mackin was safely in custody, they began \nadministering first aid.  Mackin had sustained an apparent gunshot wound to his torso \nduring the incident.   \n \nThey immediately requested emergency medical personnel to their location.  He quickly \nran back to his patrol vehicle and brought it to the location to get medical supplies out of \nthe rear.  CSO Graham had also brought his car up.  At that point, he began blocking off \nthe crime scene and preventing traffic from coming through.   \n \nHe is uncertain if Mackin fired his gun.  He believes he fired approximately 8 rounds at \nMackin during this incident.  There were several minutes between the time Mackin was \nfirst confronted and ordered out of the van, and when Mackin high sided the van, and \norders were given for him to surrender.  Mackin never complied with any of the orders \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n23 \ngiven to him to surrender.   Mackin was noncompliant throughout this incident and \nnever gave any indication he was going to surrender.  A concern of his during this \nincident was not being able to see what Mackin was doing, and being unable to \ndetermine if Mackin was pointing the handgun at them while Mackin was moving \naround in the van.    \n \nDuring this incident, he never had any reason to believe the handgun Mackin had was \nanything other than a real firearm, which could cause death or serious bodily harm.  He \nbelieved that when Mackin was raising the handgun toward officers, Mackin had the \nability, intent, and opportunity to gravely harm or kill him and his fellow officers.   \n \nAfter our interview, Officer Armstrong indicated that he had not spoken with anyone about the \nincident other than his attorney and had not viewed body-worn camera footage before the \ninterview.  Officer Armstrong was offered an opportunity to review his body-worn camera \nfootage; however, he declined.  Officer Armstrong had nothing further to add, so we ended our \ninterview.   \n \nOn Tuesday, October 3, 2023, at 1115 hours, Detective Duffy and I met with Officer Borg and his \nattorney, Michael Rains of Rains, Lucia, Stern, St. Phalle & Silver, PC.  We met in the second floor \nconference room of the administrative wing of the Antioch Police Department.  This interview \nwas digitally recorded with Officer Borg's knowledge.

He has been a police officer for the \nAntioch Police Department for 4 ½ years and has attended several P.O.S.T. certified \ntrainings in his career.  He is currently enrolled in Cal Coast College for his bachelor's \ndegree.   \n \nAfter Officer Borg provided his training and experience, I asked him to explain what happened \nthat led to the officer involved shooting.  Officer Borg in substance told us the following:  \n \nOfficer Borg's Interview:  \nHe had a full night's sleep the night before this incident and was well rested.  He was \ndressed in the APD class \"C\" uniform, which is their BDU uniform.  He was wearing an \nouter load vest cover with APD patches on each shoulder and an embroidered star on \nhis left chest.  He was wearing his duty belt, and carrying his department issued firearm.  \nHis firearm is a 9mm, Glock 17, Gen 5 department issued firearm, which was fully loaded \nand has a capacity of 17 rounds in the magazine.  He had one round in the chamber \nwhich gave him a total of 18 rounds, which is how he was carrying it on the day of the \nincident.  He also had two additional magazines with him that were both loaded to a \ncapacity of 17 rounds each.  He was wearing a department issued body camera, which \nwas activated during the incident.    \n \nHe is a training officer and Officer Armstrong is his trainee.  After the briefing on Sunday, \nOctober 1, 2023, he gave Officer Armstrong a tour of the department, as this was Officer \nArmstrong’s first day on patrol.  While touring the police department, he heard the \ndetails of Officer Marques' call with a possible stolen vehicle and an unresponsive man \nsleeping in a different vehicle, with a gun in plain view.   He and Officer Armstrong \nrespond to the location in their fully marked patrol vehicle.   \n \nUpon arrival at A Street and W. 3rd Street, he parked their patrol vehicle on W. 3rd \nStreet.  He could see 2-3 patrol vehicles with their emergency lights on, parked in the \ndriveway facing the carport area of the apartments.  The officers were conducting a \nhigh-risk stop and ordering a person out of a van.   He and Officer Armstrong \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n25 \nimmediately got out of their patrol vehicle and took cover behind the patrol vehicles in \nthe driveway area.   He spoke with Officer Dibble who confirmed that the van was the \ninvolved vehicle.     \n \nAt this point, he took a position on the passenger side of a patrol vehicle, and directed \nOfficer Armstrong to stay with him.  Both he and Officer Armstrong drew their sidearms \nand pointed them at the blue van.  Officers began giving orders to the person in the blue \nvan to surrender and come out with his hands up (this person was later identified as \nMackin).   After a few moments, he saw Mackin move into the driver's seat of the blue \nvan.  It was difficult to see into the van because there was a curtain dividing the front \nseat and the rear cargo area.  The side windows of the van were also tinted, making it \ndifficult to see into the van.  Mackin did not comply with their orders to give up during \nthe 2-3 minutes Mackin was being ordered out of the van.  All the officers were in full \nuniform, and the patrol vehicles were fully marked, with the emergency lights on.   \n \nAt this point, Mackin moved into the driver's seat, and he could hear Mackin trying to \nstart the van.  Officers gave Mackin orders to not start the van and to come out with his \nhands up; however, Mackin did not comply.  Mackin put the van into drive and \naccelerated, driving towards the officers.  Mackin then veered away from the officers \nand tried to drive over the curbed parking lot and through the vegetation in an attempt \nto drive onto A Street.  Mackin hit a metal utility box and got the van stuck in a grassy \narea.  Mackin began to reverse the van and drive it forward in an attempt to free it.       \n \nAt this point, things became chaotic with officers talking over each other and giving \nMackin commands to surrender.  He quickly returned to his patrol vehicle, in the event \nMackin was able to free the van and a vehicle pursuit ensued.  Once he realized Mackin \nwas unable to free the van, he returned to his position of cover at the patrol vehicle \nparked in the driveway.  He noticed that Officer Marques had his police K9 out.  At this \npoint, they all had taken cover near their patrol vehicles in the area behind the van.  \nOfficer Mulholland had the 40mm less lethal deployed.  They were trying to deescalate \nthe situation by shooting out the driver's side window in an attempt to gain Mackin's \ncompliance with their orders to surrender.    \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n26 \n \nHe yelled out to Officer Mulholland to have one person give commands, so it wouldn't \nbe so chaotic and Mackin could understand.  He was at the rear of the van; \nunfortunately, the rear windows were tinted, and he could not see where Mackin was.   \nHe requested dispatch contact the Brentwood Police Department to see if they had stop \nsticks available in the event Mackin was able to get the van free.   \n \nAfter 2-3 minutes, he saw the side passenger door open and Mackin jumped out of the \nvan.  Mackin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and shorts with the hood up over his \nhead.  He could see that Mackin had his left hand in the front pocket of the sweatshirt or \nthe front of his waistband.  He started yelling orders for Mackin to surrender and to put \nhis hands up.  He yelled out that Mackin had exited the van, and he was now reaching \nfor something.  He and Mackin made eye contact and Mackin fled eastbound across the \ncurbline of the parking lot and onto A Street.   \n \nHe gave chase and took an angle to the right in an attempt to cut Mackin off.  As he ran \nup a dirt embankment, he tripped and fell to the ground.  He quickly got up and \ncontinued to pursue Mackin.   He could now see Mackin was running with a handgun in \nhis left hand.  As Mackin fled from him, Mackin turned and looked at him while holding \nthe handgun in his left hand.  He believed that Mackin was attempting to gain a sight \npicture of the pursuing officers.  At this time, he felt he needed to use lethal force to \nstop Mackin and prevent him from shooting any officers.  He believed Mackin had the \nintention to harm someone, and Mackin could cause death or harm to officers or \ncitizens.  He then fired at least one round at Mackin.   He estimates he was 15-20 feet \naway from Mackin at the time he initially engaged him.   \n \nMackin ran a short distance and then collapsed on the sidewalk on the north side of A \nStreet.  When Mackin fell to the ground, he fell in a seated position on the sidewalk.  \nMackin was facing him and his fellow officers.  He recalled Officer Marques was to his \nimmediate left and they were close together.  Mackin was now holding the handgun in \nhis right hand and began raising it, at which time he could see the silver barrel of the gun \npointed at him.   He thought Mackin fired a shot at him because he heard a shot come \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n27 \nfrom Mackin's direction, but he did not see a muzzle flash or see the handgun recoil.  \nBased on this, he fired several rounds at Mackin.   \n \nAfter firing at Mackin, Mackin got onto his feet again, and was still holding the handgun \nin his right hand.  He conducted a tactical reload, to make sure he had a fully loaded \nfirearm.  After the tactical reload, he pointed his handgun at Mackin, however, he does \nnot recall if he fired any more shots.  Within seconds, Mackin started to flee from \nofficers again.  Mackin then threw the handgun over his head in a northern direction.   \nHe could see that Mackin was no longer armed or had anything in his hands, so he \ntransitioned to his taser and holstered his firearm.   He could see Mackin was slowing \ndown, and he began giving Mackin commands to get onto the ground.  After Mackin \ndiscarded the handgun, there were no additional shots fired by officers.   \n \nHe could see Officer Marques' K9 run passed him.  The K9 began circling Mackin; \nhowever, the K9 never engaged Mackin because of the distraction of Mackin’s dog.  At \nthis point, Mackin slowed down and collapsed onto the ground.  Mackin was \nhandcuffed, and officers began requesting a medical bag, and emergency medical \npersonnel to respond.  They also began securing the crime scene.   \n \nAfter our interview, Officer Borg indicated that he had not spoken with anyone about this \nincident other than his attorney and had not viewed body-worn camera footage before the \ninterview.  Officer Borg was offered an opportunity to review his body-worn camera footage; \nhowever, he declined.  Officer Borg had nothing further to add, so we ended our interview.   \n \nAt 1219 hours, Detective Duffy and I met with Officer Marques and his attorney, Justin \nBuffington of Rains, Lucia, Stern, St. Phalle & Silver, PC.

Lieutenant Conaty informed me there had been an officer involved shooting \nin the city of Antioch, which involved four actor officers, and several witnessing officers.  \nLieutenant Conaty advised the suspect had been transported to the hospital and was in critical \ncondition.   \n \nAt approximately 1000 hours, I arrived at the Antioch Police Department.  Upon arrival, I met \nwith additional Inspectors from the District Attorney's Office, and Detectives from the Antioch \nPolice Department.     \n \nAt approximately 1200 hours, I attended a briefing conducted by Antioch Police Detective \nSergeant Colley regarding the shooting and what led up to it.  During the briefing, I learned the \nfollowing information:   \n \nOn Thursday, September 26, 2023, at approximately 1418 hours, Community Service \nOfficer Graham responded to the Cube Smart Self Storage located at 1790 Vineyard \nDrive in the city of Antioch.  CSO Graham was responding to the onsite manager, \n \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n13 \n, who was reporting a vehicle theft from the location.  At this time, CSO Graham \nreviewed surveillance footage of the vehicle theft, which occurred earlier the same day.  \nWhile reviewing the surveillance footage, CSO Graham saw that on Thursday, September \n26, 2023, at approximately 0130 hours, two unknown male subjects were walking \naround inside the storage yard.  At approximately 0152 hours, a blue or purple panel van \nis seen entering the storage yard via the rear gate, located at the end of Vineyard Drive.  \nThe panel van then can be seen pushing a white 1987 Chevrolet Monte Carlo (Cal. \nLicense Plate #\n) out of the south gate of the storage yard onto E. 18th Street.  \nOnce the panel van and the Monte Carlo exited the south gate, CSO Graham was unable \nto see them because it was out of the surveillance camera's view.   \n \nadvised that nobody had permission to be at the storage yard, at that \ntime.   \nthen provided CSO Graham with the owner of the Monte Carlo \npersonal information.  CSO Graham made telephone contact with the owner of the \nMonte Carlo, (\n who currently resides in Florida, and he advised that he \ndid not give anyone permission to have his vehicle.  CSO Graham completed a stolen \nvehicle report, and requested the surveillance footage of the incident from Cube Smart \nSelf Storage, as evidence of the theft.  CSO Graham later entered the stolen Monte Carlo \ninto the Stolen Vehicle System (SVS) and returned to his duties.   \n \nOn Sunday, October 1, 2023, at approximately 0741 hours, CSO Graham was conducting \nhis patrol duties, when he noticed a white Chevrolet Monte Carlo backed into the \ncarport of \n  The Monte Carlo was covered with a tarp.  CSO \nGraham noticed a blue panel van backed into the carport next to the Monte Carlo.  CSO \nGraham believed the blue panel van was similar to the one he saw involved with the \ntheft of the Monte Carlo on Thursday, September 26, 2023.  Based on this, CSO Graham \ncontacted dispatch, and requested assistance from patrol.  K-9 Officer Marques \nresponded to assist CSO Graham, as did Officer Dibble, Officer Mulholland, and his \nTrainee Officer Posey.   \n \nOfficer Marques arrived on the scene followed by Officer Dibble.  The officers \napproached the suspected stolen Monte Carlo, pulled back the tarp, and discovered it \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n14 \nwas unoccupied.  Officer Marques confirmed the Monte Carlo was the stolen vehicle \nCSO Graham had been investigating on Thursday, September 26, 2023.  Officer Marques \nthen conducted a record check of the blue panel van which had a license plate of \n.  This vehicle returned with an expired registration in 2018.  Officer Marques \nbegan looking into the interior of the blue panel van through the side cargo door \nwindows on the passenger side.  As Officer Marques did this, he noticed someone (later \nidentified as suspect Daniel Mackin) was sleeping in the rear cargo area of the vehicle \nwith a handgun lying next to him in plain view.   \n \nOfficer Marques advised dispatch of this observation, and the officers quickly backed \naway from the suspect vehicle and took cover near their patrol vehicles.  At this point, \nOfficer Mulholland and his trainee, Officer Posey arrived on the scene.  Hearing this \ninformation over the radio, Officer Borg, and his trainee, Officer Armstrong responded as \nwell.  Officers noticed that Mackin was now awake, and looking out the front windshield \nat the Antioch Police Officers surrounding the van.  Officers began giving Mackin orders \nto step out of the van with his hands up, however, he did not comply.  Officers Borg and \nOfficer Armstrong arrived on the scene and took a position near Officer Marques' patrol \nvehicle.  \n \nAt this time, Mackin got into the driver's seat of the van and started it.  Mackin then \nattempted to flee, by driving the van through the apartment building's parking lot over a \ncurb/green belt area, and onto A Street.  The van then hit a utility box, and a street sign \npole, at which time it became stuck.  Officers continued to give Mackin orders to come \nout of the van, but Mackin refused.  Mackin began to back up and drive forward several \ntimes, in an attempt to free the van and escape.  At this time, Officer Mulholland utilized \na 40mm less lethal weapon to break out the driver's side window of the van.  After four \nunsuccessful attempts to break the van's driver's side window, Mackin fled on foot out \nthe side cargo doors of the van.   \n \nAs Mackin fled from the van he was holding something in his waistband or hooded \nsweatshirt front pocket with his left hand.  As Mackin fled eastbound on A Street, Officer \nMarques deployed his police K-9 to apprehend him.  As Mackin fled he was followed by \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n15 \na small dog that had been inside the van.  The small dog distracted the police K-9, which \nprevented the K-9 from apprehending Mackin.  As Mackin ran, the officers could now \nsee a chrome handgun in his right hand.   \n \nAs Mackin continued to run east, he turned several times toward the police officers \npursuing him, and was now pointing the handgun in their direction.  The pursuing \nofficers, then fired several times at Mackin as he fled.  At one point Mackin fell to the \nground and came to rest in a seated position on the north curbline, still pointing the \nhandgun at the officers.  Officers then fired additional shots at Mackin as he got to his \nfeet, still pointing the handgun in the direction of pursuing officers.  Mackin continued to \nrun eastbound on A Street, with the handgun in his right hand.  As Mackin ran, he threw \nthe handgun, over his head in a northern direction.  The handgun landed on the north \nsidewalk of A Street, where it was later recovered fully, loaded with six live rounds.   \n \nOnce the handgun was discarded, officers verbally announced Mackin had discarded it, \nand no other shots were fired.  Mackin ran approximately another 10-15 yards until he \ncame to a stop, went to his knees, and laid down on the ground in the middle of A \nstreet.  Officers approached Mackin who had sustained one through and through \ngunshot wound to his torso.  Mackin was immediately handcuffed, and emergency \nmedical personnel were requested.  Officers obtained a medical kit from a patrol vehicle, \nand began administering first aid.  Fire and ambulance personnel arrived and Mackin \nwas transported to John Muir Hospital, Walnut Creek Campus.  Per medical staff at John \nMuir Hospital, Mackin had sustained injuries to both lungs as a result of being shot.  \nMackin was intubated and was being treated for his injuries.   \n \nAfter Sergeant Colley's briefing, we reviewed the body-worn camera footage of the involved \nofficers.

The Contra Costa \nCrime Lab, Contra Costa District Attorney's Office, and Antioch PD Crime Scene Investigators \nwere also on the scene conducting their duties.  I could see the blue van Mackin attempted to \nflee in, had struck a utility box and a street sign pole from driving over the curbed parking lot \nand into the vegetation between the parking lot and A Street.  In an easterly direction on A \nStreet, I could see several crime scene plaques marking numerous expended shell casings.   \nFurther east on the north sidewalk of A Street, I saw another crime scene plaque that marked a \nchrome revolver.  A short distance further east was clothing and blood in the middle of the \nstreet.   \n \n is a three story apartment complex comprised of the first floor being eight \nstorage units and a carport.

The apartments all face north with a common parking lot that is \naccessible from a W. 3rd Street entry/exit point.  \n \nAfter assessing the crime scene, Detective Duffy and I responded back to the Antioch Police \nDepartment.  Upon our arrival, we were advised that the actor officers were not going to \nprovide statements that day, and those interviews were scheduled for Tuesday, October 3, 2023, \nat 1000 hours, at the Antioch Police Department.   \n \nIn preparation for the interviews of the officers, Detective Duffy and I conducted a further \nreview of the body-worn camera footage of the incident.  This was done in an attempt to \ndetermine when the last shot was fired, relative to when Mackin discarded the handgun.  At \n08:05:51 hours the last shot was fired and at 08:05:54 hours, Mackin discards the handgun.  \nThis was confirmed by the Antioch Police Department's shot spotter system and the officers' \nbody-worn cameras.   \n \nOn Tuesday, October 3, 2023, at 1011 hours, Detective Duffy and I met with Officer Armstrong \nand his attorney, Michael Rains of Rains, Lucia, Stern, St. Phalle & Silver, PC.  We met in the \nsecond floor conference room of the administrative wing of the Antioch Police Department.  \nThis interview was digitally recorded with Officer Armstrong's knowledge.  After introducing \nourselves, I initiated the interview by explaining to Officer Armstrong that the purpose of the \ninterview was to determine the facts and circumstances that surround this incident.   \n \nI also told Officer Armstrong this was a voluntary statement, and that he could stop at any time \nif he needed to take a break or speak with his attorney.  Officer Armstrong told me he \nunderstood.  I then asked Officer Armstrong to tell me about his background, including his \ntraining and experience.  Officer Armstrong in substance told us the following:  \n \nOfficer Kyle Armstrong Training and Experience:  \nHe attended the basic police academy and was hired by the Antioch Police Department.  \nHe has been in orientation training for approximately a week, and Sunday, October 1, \n2023, was his first day on patrol.

He does not have any prior law enforcement \nexperience and has a high school diploma and some college; however, he does not have \na degree.   \n \nAfter Officer Armstrong provided his training and experience, I asked him to explain what \nhappened that led to the officer involved shooting.  Officer Armstrong in substance told us the \nfollowing:  \n \nOfficer Kyle Armstrong Statement:  \nSunday, October 1, 2023, was his first day in the field training program.  He works from \n0630 hours until 1900 hours, which is a red day's schedule.  He had a good night's sleep \nand was well rested and ready for his day.  He was dressed in the Antioch Police \nUniform, with visible A.P.D. patches on his shoulders and an embroidered badge as well \nas a duty belt with his department issued firearm.  His firearm is a 9mm, Glock 17, Gen 5 \ndepartment issued handgun, which can carry a standard 17-round magazine plus one \nadditional round in the chamber.  He was loaded with 16 rounds in the magazine and \none in the chamber.  He also had two additional magazines with him.  One had 16 \nrounds and the other had 17 rounds.  He was short 2 rounds of duty ammunition, \nbecause while he was at the range the week before he dropped two rounds on the \nground and never found them.  He was wearing a department issued body camera, \nwhich was activated during this incident.    \n \nHe attended a briefing with his Training Officer, Officer Borg.  After the briefing, they \ncollected paperwork he would need in preparation for his day.  As they did this, there \nwas a call over the police radio of a subject sleeping in a vehicle with a firearm in his \nhand.  Officer Borg told him they were going to respond to the call, so they headed to \ntheir fully marked A.P.D. patrol vehicle.  Once at their patrol vehicle, they responded to \nthe detail.  As they responded, Officer Borg had him read the details of the call from the \ncomputer (Mobil Data Terminal, M.D.T.).  The details of this call were that officers had \nlocated a possible stolen vehicle, and next to the vehicle a subject was sleeping in a van \nwith a firearm in his lap.   \n \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n20 \nThey drove down 2nd Street to respond to the call, and did not turn on any emergency \nlights or siren to get there.  Upon arrival, they parked their patrol vehicle, and he could \nsee Training Officer Mulholland and his trainee, Officer Posey.  He also saw Officer \nDibble and K9 Officer Marques.  He could see two patrol vehicles facing a blue panel van \nwith their overhead emergency lights on.  He also could see officers pointing their \nfirearms at the van and giving commands to a subject inside the van (later identified as \nDaniel Mackin).   He and Officer Borg drew their firearms, and took a position to assist.   \n \nHe could not see anyone in the van at this time; however, he was told Mackin was in the \nback of the van, and he could see some movement inside.  There was a curtain between \nthe front compartment of the van and the cargo area in the back, which prevented him \nfrom clearly seeing into the van.  From this vantage point, he could see the curtains \ndividing the front and the back of the van shift as if someone had crawled underneath \nthem to move to the front of the cabin.  Suddenly he could see Mackin in the driver's \nseat, as the van's engine started.     \n \nNumerous commands were given to Mackin to get out of the van; however, Mackin did \nnot comply.  Mackin put the van in drive, and started to pull out of the parking stall he \nwas backed into.  Mackin attempted to drive over the curb bordering the parking lot and \nonto A Street; however, the van became stuck or high-sided in the vegetation between \nthe parking lot and A Street.  Mackin also hit a utility box and a street sign pole with the \nfront of the van.   \n \nAt this point, Officer Borg ran back to their patrol vehicle and turned it around.  Officer \nBorg positioned the vehicle facing northbound on 3rd Street in the event Mackin was \nable to drive away and a vehicle pursuit ensued.  Officers continued to give Mackin \nverbal commands to surrender.  He noticed that K9 Officer Marques had retrieved his K9 \nfrom his patrol vehicle.  At this point, they all had taken cover near their patrol vehicles \nin the area behind the van.  Officer Mulholland utilized a 40mm less lethal gun in an \nattempt to break out the driver's side window of the van.  This was not effective as the \nrubber rounds ricocheted off the van.  Officer Mulholland continued to fire several \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n21 \nrounds at the van, but he was uncertain how many.  The rounds just kept ricocheting off \nthe van, which he believed was due to the angle Officer Mulholland was firing from.   \n \nHe could see Mackin moved out of the driver's compartment area and back into the rear \ncargo area of the van.  He could no longer see Mackin, and they were aware he was still \nin possession of the handgun.  Officer Mulholland ran out of ammunition for the 40mm, \nso Mulholland moved to another vehicle to retrieve more.  During this time, Mackin \ncontinued to try and free the van by backing up and driving forward.  The tires of the van \nwere just spinning, and he was unable to free the van.  Officer Borg requested Officer \nMulholland attempt to shoot out the back window of the van with the 40mm less lethal \nweapon.  As Officer Mulholland was repositioning himself to take a shot with the 40mm, \nthe right side cargo door of the van opened and Mackin stepped out of the van.  Officer \nBorg and Officer Mulholland both gave Mackin commands to get down on the ground, \nbut he did not comply.   \n \nMackin pulled the hood of his hooded sweatshirt up over his head.  As Mackin did this, \nhe had a small dog in the van with him that jumped out as well.  Mackin looked like he \nwas holding the handgun in his front sweatshirt pocket with his left hand as he began to \nflee eastbound on A Street.  He could see what appeared to be the handle of the \nhandgun sticking out of the sweatshirt pocket.  K9 Officer Marques deployed his K9 and \nbegan to pursue Mackin.  He and Officer Borg both gave chase as well.  As they pursued \nMackin, Officer Marques, and Officer Borg were to his left.  He was not sure where \nOfficer Mulholland, Officer Dibble, or Officer Posey were exactly; however, he knew they \nwere somewhere around him.   \n \nAs Mackin fled on foot, Mackin fell near a light pole.  When Mackin fell to the ground, \nMackin took a seated position along the curb line.  He could now see Mackin holding the \nsilver or chrome firearm in his right hand and pointing it in the direction of Officer \nMarques and Officer Borg.  He could not tell if the handgun was a revolver or a semi-\nautomatic.  He could only see the barrel of the handgun.  He feared for the lives of his \nfellow officers, at which time he felt deadly force was necessary.  He then heard a shot \nfired by one of the officers near him, possibly to his left.  He then stopped running, took \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n22 \naim, and fired approximately 2 rounds at Mackin.  He estimated he was approximately \n20 to 25 feet away from Mackin when he fired his first shots.   \n \nAt this time, he heard several rounds being fired by his fellow officers to his left.  \nHowever, Mackin did not appear to be hurt or hit, at which time Mackin got back up and \ncontinued running eastbound on A Street.  As Mackin was fleeing eastbound, Mackin \ncontinually turned, looking back at the officers pursuing him.  He wasn't sure if Mackin \nwas turning to shoot at them while fleeing, so each time Mackin turned towards them \nwith the handgun in his hand, he and the other officers would fire at Mackin.  He fired \napproximately 6 more rounds at Mackin and each time he fired, he reassessed the \nsituation.    \n \nAs Mackin fled, Mackin did what he described as a \"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar hook shot\" \nand threw the handgun with his right hand over his head in a northern direction.  Once \nMackin discarded the handgun, he yelled out to everyone, \"he dropped the gun.\"  Once \nhe yelled out that Mackin no longer had the handgun in his possession, no other shots \nwere fired.  It was unclear if Mackin was merely discarding the handgun or trying to \nthrow it into the adjacent river.   The handgun came to rest on the north sidewalk of A \nStreet.  Moments later, Mackin collapsed and fell to the ground where he was \nhandcuffed and taken into custody.  Once Mackin was safely in custody, they began \nadministering first aid.  Mackin had sustained an apparent gunshot wound to his torso \nduring the incident.   \n \nThey immediately requested emergency medical personnel to their location.  He quickly \nran back to his patrol vehicle and brought it to the location to get medical supplies out of \nthe rear.  CSO Graham had also brought his car up.  At that point, he began blocking off \nthe crime scene and preventing traffic from coming through.   \n \nHe is uncertain if Mackin fired his gun.  He believes he fired approximately 8 rounds at \nMackin during this incident.  There were several minutes between the time Mackin was \nfirst confronted and ordered out of the van, and when Mackin high sided the van, and \norders were given for him to surrender.  Mackin never complied with any of the orders \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n23 \ngiven to him to surrender.   Mackin was noncompliant throughout this incident and \nnever gave any indication he was going to surrender.  A concern of his during this \nincident was not being able to see what Mackin was doing, and being unable to \ndetermine if Mackin was pointing the handgun at them while Mackin was moving \naround in the van.    \n \nDuring this incident, he never had any reason to believe the handgun Mackin had was \nanything other than a real firearm, which could cause death or serious bodily harm.  He \nbelieved that when Mackin was raising the handgun toward officers, Mackin had the \nability, intent, and opportunity to gravely harm or kill him and his fellow officers.   \n \nAfter our interview, Officer Armstrong indicated that he had not spoken with anyone about the \nincident other than his attorney and had not viewed body-worn camera footage before the \ninterview.  Officer Armstrong was offered an opportunity to review his body-worn camera \nfootage; however, he declined.  Officer Armstrong had nothing further to add, so we ended our \ninterview.   \n \nOn Tuesday, October 3, 2023, at 1115 hours, Detective Duffy and I met with Officer Borg and his \nattorney, Michael Rains of Rains, Lucia, Stern, St. Phalle & Silver, PC.  We met in the second floor \nconference room of the administrative wing of the Antioch Police Department.  This interview \nwas digitally recorded with Officer Borg's knowledge.  After introducing ourselves, I initiated the \ninterview by explaining to Officer Borg that the purpose of the interview was to determine the \nfacts and circumstances that surround this incident.   \n \nI also told Officer Borg that this is a voluntary statement, and he could stop at any time if he \nneeded to take a break or speak with his attorney.  Officer Borg told me he understood.  I then \nasked Officer Borg to tell me about his background, including his training and experience.  \nOfficer Borg in substance told us the following:  \n \n \nOfficer Borg's Training and Experience:  \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n24 \nHe attended a basic police academy and worked for the Alameda County Sheriff's \nDepartment as a Deputy Sheriff for 12 ½ years.  He has been a police officer for the \nAntioch Police Department for 4 ½ years and has attended several P.O.S.T. certified \ntrainings in his career.  He is currently enrolled in Cal Coast College for his bachelor's \ndegree.   \n \nAfter Officer Borg provided his training and experience, I asked him to explain what happened \nthat led to the officer involved shooting.  Officer Borg in substance told us the following:  \n \nOfficer Borg's Interview:  \nHe had a full night's sleep the night before this incident and was well rested.  He was \ndressed in the APD class \"C\" uniform, which is their BDU uniform.  He was wearing an \nouter load vest cover with APD patches on each shoulder and an embroidered star on \nhis left chest.  He was wearing his duty belt, and carrying his department issued firearm.  \nHis firearm is a 9mm, Glock 17, Gen 5 department issued firearm, which was fully loaded \nand has a capacity of 17 rounds in the magazine.  He had one round in the chamber \nwhich gave him a total of 18 rounds, which is how he was carrying it on the day of the \nincident.  He also had two additional magazines with him that were both loaded to a \ncapacity of 17 rounds each.  He was wearing a department issued body camera, which \nwas activated during the incident.    \n \nHe is a training officer and Officer Armstrong is his trainee.  After the briefing on Sunday, \nOctober 1, 2023, he gave Officer Armstrong a tour of the department, as this was Officer \nArmstrong’s first day on patrol.  While touring the police department, he heard the \ndetails of Officer Marques' call with a possible stolen vehicle and an unresponsive man \nsleeping in a different vehicle, with a gun in plain view.   He and Officer Armstrong \nrespond to the location in their fully marked patrol vehicle.   \n \nUpon arrival at A Street and W. 3rd Street, he parked their patrol vehicle on W. 3rd \nStreet.  He could see 2-3 patrol vehicles with their emergency lights on, parked in the \ndriveway facing the carport area of the apartments.  The officers were conducting a \nhigh-risk stop and ordering a person out of a van.   He and Officer Armstrong \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n25 \nimmediately got out of their patrol vehicle and took cover behind the patrol vehicles in \nthe driveway area.   He spoke with Officer Dibble who confirmed that the van was the \ninvolved vehicle.     \n \nAt this point, he took a position on the passenger side of a patrol vehicle, and directed \nOfficer Armstrong to stay with him.  Both he and Officer Armstrong drew their sidearms \nand pointed them at the blue van.  Officers began giving orders to the person in the blue \nvan to surrender and come out with his hands up (this person was later identified as \nMackin).   After a few moments, he saw Mackin move into the driver's seat of the blue \nvan.  It was difficult to see into the van because there was a curtain dividing the front \nseat and the rear cargo area.  The side windows of the van were also tinted, making it \ndifficult to see into the van.  Mackin did not comply with their orders to give up during \nthe 2-3 minutes Mackin was being ordered out of the van.  All the officers were in full \nuniform, and the patrol vehicles were fully marked, with the emergency lights on.   \n \nAt this point, Mackin moved into the driver's seat, and he could hear Mackin trying to \nstart the van.  Officers gave Mackin orders to not start the van and to come out with his \nhands up; however, Mackin did not comply.  Mackin put the van into drive and \naccelerated, driving towards the officers.  Mackin then veered away from the officers \nand tried to drive over the curbed parking lot and through the vegetation in an attempt \nto drive onto A Street.  Mackin hit a metal utility box and got the van stuck in a grassy \narea.  Mackin began to reverse the van and drive it forward in an attempt to free it.       \n \nAt this point, things became chaotic with officers talking over each other and giving \nMackin commands to surrender.  He quickly returned to his patrol vehicle, in the event \nMackin was able to free the van and a vehicle pursuit ensued.  Once he realized Mackin \nwas unable to free the van, he returned to his position of cover at the patrol vehicle \nparked in the driveway.  He noticed that Officer Marques had his police K9 out.  At this \npoint, they all had taken cover near their patrol vehicles in the area behind the van.  \nOfficer Mulholland had the 40mm less lethal deployed.  They were trying to deescalate \nthe situation by shooting out the driver's side window in an attempt to gain Mackin's \ncompliance with their orders to surrender.    \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n26 \n \nHe yelled out to Officer Mulholland to have one person give commands, so it wouldn't \nbe so chaotic and Mackin could understand.  He was at the rear of the van; \nunfortunately, the rear windows were tinted, and he could not see where Mackin was.   \nHe requested dispatch contact the Brentwood Police Department to see if they had stop \nsticks available in the event Mackin was able to get the van free.   \n \nAfter 2-3 minutes, he saw the side passenger door open and Mackin jumped out of the \nvan.  Mackin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and shorts with the hood up over his \nhead.  He could see that Mackin had his left hand in the front pocket of the sweatshirt or \nthe front of his waistband.  He started yelling orders for Mackin to surrender and to put \nhis hands up.  He yelled out that Mackin had exited the van, and he was now reaching \nfor something.  He and Mackin made eye contact and Mackin fled eastbound across the \ncurbline of the parking lot and onto A Street.   \n \nHe gave chase and took an angle to the right in an attempt to cut Mackin off.  As he ran \nup a dirt embankment, he tripped and fell to the ground.  He quickly got up and \ncontinued to pursue Mackin.   He could now see Mackin was running with a handgun in \nhis left hand.  As Mackin fled from him, Mackin turned and looked at him while holding \nthe handgun in his left hand.  He believed that Mackin was attempting to gain a sight \npicture of the pursuing officers.  At this time, he felt he needed to use lethal force to \nstop Mackin and prevent him from shooting any officers.  He believed Mackin had the \nintention to harm someone, and Mackin could cause death or harm to officers or \ncitizens.  He then fired at least one round at Mackin.   He estimates he was 15-20 feet \naway from Mackin at the time he initially engaged him.   \n \nMackin ran a short distance and then collapsed on the sidewalk on the north side of A \nStreet.  When Mackin fell to the ground, he fell in a seated position on the sidewalk.  \nMackin was facing him and his fellow officers.  He recalled Officer Marques was to his \nimmediate left and they were close together.  Mackin was now holding the handgun in \nhis right hand and began raising it, at which time he could see the silver barrel of the gun \npointed at him.   He thought Mackin fired a shot at him because he heard a shot come \nDocuSign Envelope ID: 83C48DCC-8B25-4398-B589-898679103D0E\nContra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \nSupplemental Report \n \n \n \nSubject / Defendant: \nMackin, Daniel Jackson D.O.B. 8/16/1993 \nDocket / Report No. \nAntioch PD Case #23-007441 \nCrime Lab Case # 23-3800-1 \nDA’s Office Case #23-012 \n \nWritten By: \n \nInspector Kirk Sullivan #214 \nDate: 10/1/2023 \n \n27 \nfrom Mackin's direction, but he did not see a muzzle flash or see the handgun recoil.  \nBased on this, he fired several rounds at Mackin.   \n \nAfter firing at Mackin, Mackin got onto his feet again, and was still holding the handgun \nin his right hand.  He conducted a tactical reload, to make sure he had a fully loaded \nfirearm.  After the tactical reload, he pointed his handgun at Mackin, however, he does \nnot recall if he fired any more shots.  Within seconds, Mackin started to flee from \nofficers again.  Mackin then threw the handgun over his head in a northern direction.   \nHe could see that Mackin was no longer armed or had anything in his hands, so he \ntransitioned to his taser and holstered his firearm.   He could see Mackin was slowing \ndown, and he began giving Mackin commands to get onto the ground.  After Mackin \ndiscarded the handgun, there were no additional shots fired by officers.   \n \nHe could see Officer Marques' K9 run passed him.  The K9 began circling Mackin; \nhowever, the K9 never engaged Mackin because of the distraction of Mackin’s dog.  At \nthis point, Mackin slowed down and collapsed onto the ground.  Mackin was \nhandcuffed, and officers began requesting a medical bag, and emergency medical \npersonnel to respond.  They also began securing the crime scene.   \n \nAfter our interview, Officer Borg indicated that he had not spoken with anyone about this \nincident other than his attorney and had not viewed body-worn camera footage before the \ninterview.  Officer Borg was offered an opportunity to review his body-worn camera footage; \nhowever, he declined.

I responded to the request for canine assistance from the \narea of Santee.  \n \nI arrived on scene at approximately 1539 hours.  \n \nUpon arrival, I met with Sergeant Shanahan #393. Sergeant Shanahan informed me his officers were \ndispatched to a call of a male being aggressive, intoxicated and hitting cars. Sergeant Shanahan said the \nparamedics were also dispatched to the incident and, upon arrival, were told the male had a gun, so they \nbacked out. When the officers arrived, they attempted to conduct a pedestrian hot stop, but the male \nwalked away and entered apartment 2502.

Officer Garcia reiterated the \nfact that Zachariah Iban was reaching for his waistband when he walked away from them and into the \napartment. I questioned the source of information about Iban possessing a firearm and she claimed it \nwas reported to the fire department from citizens, but they were unable to reach the fire department for \nfurther.  \n \nI contacted Sergeant Leyva #3394 of the Sheriff's Canine Unit. I briefed him of the incident's details and \nexpressed my concern for safety of officers who might have to enter an apartment occupied by a male \nwho resisted arrest and was reportedly armed with a firearm, despite the fact he was only wanted for \ntrespassing and resisting arrest at the time. He agreed that officer safety was priority and believed the \nutilization of a canine during such a search was reasonable. We discussed possible solutions to working \naround the fact there was a dog inside the apartment and decided it was likely best to enter the \napartment with my canine partner, Nike, on a leash in order to try to get the dog out of the apartment or \nlocked into a bathroom before continuing the search.  \n \nLieutenant Ramirez #422 of the National City Police Department arrived on scene, assuming the position \nof incident commander. I briefed with Lieutenant Ramirez and Sergeant Shanahan. I informed them I \nwas willing to assist them with a canine search inside the apartment, if they chose to make entry, but \nexpressed my concerns for there being a dog inside.

Lieutenant Ramirez informed me one of his tactical \nofficers was retrieving their armored vehicle and bringing it to the scene. He said they would start by \ngiving announcements from their armored vehicle and go from there.  \n \nWhile awaiting the arrival of the armored vehicle, I opened my vehicle's front doors and placed old \nballistic vests over each window. This provided me with more ballistic coverage should Zachariah Iban \nstart shooting from the apartment. I then retrieved my department-issued rifle from the back of my vehicle \nand placed it on my passenger seat, for quick access.  \n \nThe apartment into which Zachariah Iban fled was a second story unit on the southeast corner of an \neight-unit building. There were two upper units and two lower units facing east, with the other units facing \nwest. The entrance to the units was recessed into the middle of the eastern wall. From my position, I \ncould see all the apartment's windows, but could not see the doorway. I could only see the lower steps of \nthe stairwell, which led to the door. Some of the apartments windows were open.  \n \nThe armored vehicle arrived and parked next to my patrol vehicle. I remained on the south side of the \nbuilding with Sergeant Shanahan, Lieutenant Ramirez, a couple tactical officers, an agent and another \npatrol officer. A contact team was established at a patrol car positioned off the northeast corner of the \nbuilding. The officers moved the vehicle south a short distance in order to better observe the doorway \nand stairwell, should Zachariah Iban exit.  \n \nOfficers began making announcements from the public announcement system on the armored vehicle. \nAfter a few rounds of announcements, I noted the volume appeared low. Wanting to ensure Zachariah \nIban could hear the announcements, I requested they turn up the speaker's volume. The officer adjusted \nthe volume and continued. After making the adjustment, I felt content with the speaker's volume and \nbelieved officer's commands were sufficiently loud that they would be heard by Iban, even if he was \nsleeping in the apartment. Officers continued giving commands for Zachariah Iban to come out of the \napartment, calling him by name and giving the apartment number. Most of the officer's commands \nincluded the fact they had a police dog present and stated if he did not come out the dog would be sent \ninside and he would be bit. I believe it fair to say they gave dozens of canine warnings during the \nincident.  \n \nDuring the time when officers were giving commands, I coordinated with an officer on the contact team \nwho was holding a specialty munitions shotgun. I told him if Zachariah Iban came out of the apartment \nand was not following commands, I might request he deploy the specialty munitions shotgun in order to \ngive my canine a safer opportunity to approach, potentially preventing Iban from drawing a firearm or \nbeing able to quickly retreat back into the apartment. The officer informed me he would deploy, upon my \nrequest.  \n \nOfficers were able to evacuate the rest of the building's residents, except those who lived on the opposite \nside of the landing. Officers gave those residents an order to shelter in place in a back bedroom, not \nwanting them to overexpose themselves during an evacuation.  \n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nCrime/Incident Report \n8 \nPage 8 of 13 \n \n \nCase No. 23135188 \nCAD Event No.: \nE8730087 \nCase Disposition: \nActive \nPrimary Victim: \nState of California \nReport No. 23135188.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \nReviewed By \nSH0069 - BALINGER, JASON \nCanine Admin \nSH3394 - LEYVA, FRANK \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \nReviewed Date \n8/19/2023 9:25:48 PM \n \n08/23/2023 09:54:07 \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH2821 \nPrinted: August 25, 2023 - 2:53 PM \n \n \n \nThroughout this incident, large crowds of residents, including children, were gathered around our \nperiphery. The groups were asked to leave multiple times, but kept returning. Ultimately, officer placed \ncrime scene tape around a large portion of the complex to prevent onlookers from getting too close, \ninterfering or being in harm's way.  \n \nI was informed officers were attempting to contact probation and was later told they were obtaining a \nprobation hold warrant. This led me to believe Zachariah Iban was now arrestable for violating his \nprobation, which they said was for \n This crime is for committing an \n \n. Having been convicted of such a crime, I believed Iban \ncapable severe violence.  \n \nThe \nof apartment\n arrived on scene and expressed their concern for their dog, \n, who \nwas inside the apartment. They informed me they heard her bark and were worried for her safety. \nOfficers started making requests to Zachariah Iban to open the door and let the dog out, but Iban did not \nreply.  \n \nAfter officers made request for Zachariah Iban to release the dog from the apartment, I noticed \nmovement in a window. This was the first sign of movement, to this point. Until this point, I did not see or \nhear any movement from the apartment. Shortly thereafter, other officers confirmed they could see \nZachariah Iban pacing back and forth, viewing him through the living room window. I looked through the \nliving room window and saw him walking away from the apartment's front door, back toward the middle of \nthe apartment. Another officer later noticed Iban look out a window on the south side of the building, \nstating he moved the blinds and put his face up to the glass. This activity led me to believe Iban was \naware of our presence and likely plotting his next move. I was concerned there was the potential Iban \nmight start shooting at us and was possibly assessing our locations for possible avenues of escape.  \n \nLieutenant Ramirez informed me the dog inside the residence was reportedly a small chihuahua, which \nthe \n said might be aggressive toward other dogs. I informed Lieutenant Ramirez my concern was \nnot for the safety of Nike, rather, that if he was released into the apartment, he might start fighting with \nthe small dog, distracting us from the danger Zachariah Iban posed. I suggested if we made entry into \nthe apartment, two officers with guns enter in front of me and said I would follow with Nike on lead, \nassess and go from there.  \n \nI informed Lieutenant Ramirez I thought a flash bang could be useful, believing it might get Zachariah \nIban's attention and possibly convince him to exit. I would rather contact Iban outside the apartment than \nbe forced to make entry into the apartment. If we had to make entry into the apartment, Iban would \ncertainly have the tactical advantage. Since I knew he was aware of our presence and possibly armed \nwith a gun, I worried it was possible Iban used furniture to barricade the apartments door, could be lying \nin wait, prepared for an ambush, or might ambush us on our approach to the apartment, up the narrow \nstairwell.  \n \n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(A)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(C)\n(b)(6)(C)\n(b)(6)(B)\n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nCrime/Incident Report \n9 \nPage 9 of 13 \n \n \nCase No. 23135188 \nCAD Event No.: \nE8730087 \nCase Disposition: \nActive \nPrimary Victim: \nState of California \nReport No. 23135188.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \nReviewed By \nSH0069 - BALINGER, JASON \nCanine Admin \nSH3394 - LEYVA, FRANK \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \nReviewed Date \n8/19/2023 9:25:48 PM \n \n08/23/2023 09:54:07 \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH2821 \nPrinted: August 25, 2023 - 2:53 PM \n \n \nI was informed Lieutenant Ramirez was calling out their SWAT team and a CNT negotiator.  \n \nAt approximately 1724 hours, just over two hours after my arrival on scene and more than two and a half \nhours after the arrival of the National City Police Department, an officer advised the door was opening. At \nthe time of this announcement, I was standing on the rear, driver's-side corner of the armored vehicle. \nThere were no officers with me on that side. I decided to move forward to the driver's door of the armored \nvehicle, as a position of cover. I planned on using the door to give me a closer position from which to \nsafely deploy Nike, if necessary. As I moved toward the front of the vehicle, Zachariah Iban had already \nstumbled out into the street, from the stairs. He stumbled quickly in the direction of the contact team. \nOfficer began giving him commands to put his hands up, but he was not complying. I yelled, \"Hands up!\" \nWhen Iban regained his balance, he turned away from the officers of the contact team, not complying \nwith their commands, and started moving in my direction. I yelled at him to get on the ground three times, \nbut he continued walking toward me. While giving him commands to get on the ground, he raised his \nhands up slightly, exposing his palms, looked at me and pointed forward, with his right, index finger. I \ncould see he did not have anything in his hands, but was unable tell if there was a gun or other weapon \ntucked in his waistband.  \n \nStanding by myself on the driver's side of the armored vehicle, with Zachariah Iban advancing in my \ndirection, ignoring all commands to put his hands up, stop or get on the ground, I feared for my safety. \nThere were a handful of officers in the contact team on the other side of the apartment, but none of them \nwould be able fire if Iban produced a weapon, because I was standing on the other side of him. Further, \nknowing there was a crowd gathered all around our scene, I worried Iban might try to flee and make his \nway into the crowd. Based upon the fact the call originated because Iban was being aggressive to \nresidents, reportedly had a gun and was hitting cars, I worried he might attack anyone of the onlookers or \npotentially take them hostage. Further, if Iban reached the crowd, my force options to subdue him would \nbe greatly limited because they might put others at risk of injury. Because of this, I believed I had to stop \nhim before he got to me and certainly before he reached the crowd. Not wanting to go hands on with a \npotentially armed person, I believed the safest way of stopping Iban was to deploy Nike. No other force \noption I had at my disposal would allow me to do so, without sacrificing the safety of distance or \ncompromising my chances of success. I believed deploying Nike would likely prevent Iban from reaching \nfor a weapon or at least make it more challenging for him to manipulate one and prevent him from \nreaching me or getting to the crowd. \n \nI removed Nike's traffic lead and released my grip on his collar, giving him the command to bite \nZachariah Iban. Nike ran at Iban, jumped and bit him on the inside of his upper, right arm. As Nike bit \nIban, I ordered him to get on the ground. I drew my pistol and began walking at Iban, pointing my gun at \nhim to be better prepared, should he produce a weapon. I continued to order Iban onto the ground and \nhe sat down. Iban was holding Nike's front, right leg with his left hand and had his right arm around the \nback of Nike's neck. Iban responded to my commands to get on the ground, saying, \"Okay,\" and laid on \nhis right side. With Iban showing signs of compliance, both lying down and replying okay to my \ncommands, I believed it was safe to holster and detain him. Further, with Iban lying on his back and \nmoving to his side, I had more time to scan his body for weapons and did not see any.

I informed them not to grab his right arm and moved \naround to gain physical control of Nike. As I grasped Nike's collar with my left hand, I could see the \nofficers had sufficient control of Iban, so I used my break stick to release Nike from the bite. Nike \ninstantly released his grasp of Iban and I stepped back. The officers detained Iban in handcuffs and \nchecked him for weapons.

I briefed him of the incident's details and \nexpressed my concern for safety of officers who might have to enter an apartment occupied by a male \nwho resisted arrest and was reportedly armed with a firearm, despite the fact he was only wanted for \ntrespassing and resisting arrest at the time. He agreed that officer safety was priority and believed the \nutilization of a canine during such a search was reasonable. We discussed possible solutions to working \naround the fact there was a dog inside the apartment and decided it was likely best to enter the \napartment with my canine partner, Nike, on a leash in order to try to get the dog out of the apartment or \nlocked into a bathroom before continuing the search.  \n \nLieutenant Ramirez #422 of the National City Police Department arrived on scene, assuming the position \nof incident commander. I briefed with Lieutenant Ramirez and Sergeant Shanahan. I informed them I \nwas willing to assist them with a canine search inside the apartment, if they chose to make entry, but \nexpressed my concerns for there being a dog inside. I told them I might have to start the search on lead \nuntil the dog was removed from the search area. Lieutenant Ramirez informed me one of his tactical \nofficers was retrieving their armored vehicle and bringing it to the scene. He said they would start by \ngiving announcements from their armored vehicle and go from there.  \n \nWhile awaiting the arrival of the armored vehicle, I opened my vehicle's front doors and placed old \nballistic vests over each window. This provided me with more ballistic coverage should Zachariah Iban \nstart shooting from the apartment. I then retrieved my department-issued rifle from the back of my vehicle \nand placed it on my passenger seat, for quick access.  \n \nThe apartment into which Zachariah Iban fled was a second story unit on the southeast corner of an \neight-unit building. There were two upper units and two lower units facing east, with the other units facing \nwest. The entrance to the units was recessed into the middle of the eastern wall. From my position, I \ncould see all the apartment's windows, but could not see the doorway. I could only see the lower steps of \nthe stairwell, which led to the door. Some of the apartments windows were open.  \n \nThe armored vehicle arrived and parked next to my patrol vehicle. I remained on the south side of the \nbuilding with Sergeant Shanahan, Lieutenant Ramirez, a couple tactical officers, an agent and another \npatrol officer. A contact team was established at a patrol car positioned off the northeast corner of the \nbuilding. The officers moved the vehicle south a short distance in order to better observe the doorway \nand stairwell, should Zachariah Iban exit.  \n(b)(6)(A)\n(b)(6)(B)\n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nPublic Records Request \nVictim Copy \n5 \nPage 5 of 10 \n \n \nCase No. 23135188 \nPrimary Victim: \nState of California \nReport No. 23135188.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \n \nSH0069 - BALINGER, JASON \nCanine Admin \n \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \n \n08/19/2023 21:25:48 \n \n \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH2821 \nPrinted: August 25, 2023 - 2:53 PM \n \n \n \nOfficers began making announcements from the public announcement system on the armored vehicle. \nAfter a few rounds of announcements, I noted the volume appeared low. Wanting to ensure Zachariah \nIban could hear the announcements, I requested they turn up the speaker's volume. The officer adjusted \nthe volume and continued. After making the adjustment, I felt content with the speaker's volume and \nbelieved officer's commands were sufficiently loud that they would be heard by Iban, even if he was \nsleeping in the apartment. Officers continued giving commands for Zachariah Iban to come out of the \napartment, calling him by name and giving the apartment number. Most of the officer's commands \nincluded the fact they had a police dog present and stated if he did not come out the dog would be sent \ninside and he would be bit. I believe it fair to say they gave dozens of canine warnings during the \nincident.  \n \nDuring the time when officers were giving commands, I coordinated with an officer on the contact team \nwho was holding a specialty munitions shotgun. I told him if Zachariah Iban came out of the apartment \nand was not following commands, I might request he deploy the specialty munitions shotgun in order to \ngive my canine a safer opportunity to approach, potentially preventing Iban from drawing a firearm or \nbeing able to quickly retreat back into the apartment. The officer informed me he would deploy, upon my \nrequest.  \n \nOfficers were able to evacuate the rest of the building's residents, except those who lived on the opposite \nside of the landing. Officers gave those residents an order to shelter in place in a back bedroom, not \nwanting them to overexpose themselves during an evacuation.  \n \nThroughout this incident, large crowds of residents, including children, were gathered around our \nperiphery. The groups were asked to leave multiple times, but kept returning. Ultimately, officer placed \ncrime scene tape around a large portion of the complex to prevent onlookers from getting too close, \ninterfering or being in harm's way.  \n \nI was informed officers were attempting to contact probation and was later told they were obtaining a \nprobation hold warrant. This led me to believe Zachariah Iban was now arrestable for violating his \nprobation, which they said was for \n \n \n Having been convicted of such a crime, I believed Iban \ncapable severe violence.  \n \nThe \nof apartment \n arrived on scene and expressed their concern for their dog,\n who \nwas inside the apartment. They informed me they heard her bark and were worried for her safety. \nOfficers started making requests to Zachariah Iban to open the door and let the dog out, but Iban did not \nreply.  \n \nAfter officers made request for Zachariah Iban to release the dog from the apartment, I noticed \nmovement in a window. This was the first sign of movement, to this point. Until this point, I did not see or \nhear any movement from the apartment. Shortly thereafter, other officers confirmed they could see \nZachariah Iban pacing back and forth, viewing him through the living room window.

Another officer later noticed Iban look out a window on the south side of the building, \nstating he moved the blinds and put his face up to the glass. This activity led me to believe Iban was \naware of our presence and likely plotting his next move. I was concerned there was the potential Iban \nmight start shooting at us and was possibly assessing our locations for possible avenues of escape.  \n \nLieutenant Ramirez informed me the dog inside the residence was reportedly a small chihuahua, which \nthe owner said might be aggressive toward other dogs. I informed Lieutenant Ramirez my concern was \nnot for the safety of Nike, rather, that if he was released into the apartment, he might start fighting with \nthe small dog, distracting us from the danger Zachariah Iban posed. I suggested if we made entry into \nthe apartment, two officers with guns enter in front of me and said I would follow with Nike on lead, \nassess and go from there.  \n \nI informed Lieutenant Ramirez I thought a flash bang could be useful, believing it might get Zachariah \nIban's attention and possibly convince him to exit. I would rather contact Iban outside the apartment than \nbe forced to make entry into the apartment. If we had to make entry into the apartment, Iban would \ncertainly have the tactical advantage. Since I knew he was aware of our presence and possibly armed \nwith a gun, I worried it was possible Iban used furniture to barricade the apartments door, could be lying \nin wait, prepared for an ambush, or might ambush us on our approach to the apartment, up the narrow \nstairwell.  \n \nI was informed Lieutenant Ramirez was calling out their SWAT team and a CNT negotiator.  \n \nAt approximately 1724 hours, just over two hours after my arrival on scene and more than two and a half \nhours after the arrival of the National City Police Department, an officer advised the door was opening. At \nthe time of this announcement, I was standing on the rear, driver's-side corner of the armored vehicle. \nThere were no officers with me on that side. I decided to move forward to the driver's door of the armored \nvehicle, as a position of cover. I planned on using the door to give me a closer position from which to \nsafely deploy Nike, if necessary. As I moved toward the front of the vehicle, Zachariah Iban had already \nstumbled out into the street, from the stairs. He stumbled quickly in the direction of the contact team. \nOfficer began giving him commands to put his hands up, but he was not complying. I yelled, \"Hands up!\" \nWhen Iban regained his balance, he turned away from the officers of the contact team, not complying \nwith their commands, and started moving in my direction. I yelled at him to get on the ground three times, \nbut he continued walking toward me. While giving him commands to get on the ground, he raised his \nhands up slightly, exposing his palms, looked at me and pointed forward, with his right, index finger. I \ncould see he did not have anything in his hands, but was unable tell if there was a gun or other weapon \ntucked in his waistband.  \n \nStanding by myself on the driver's side of the armored vehicle, with Zachariah Iban advancing in my \ndirection, ignoring all commands to put his hands up, stop or get on the ground, I feared for my safety. \nThere were a handful of officers in the contact team on the other side of the apartment, but none of them \nwould be able fire if Iban produced a weapon, because I was standing on the other side of him. Further, \nknowing there was a crowd gathered all around our scene, I worried Iban might try to flee and make his \n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nPublic Records Request \nVictim Copy \n7 \nPage 7 of 10 \n \n \nCase No. 23135188 \nPrimary Victim: \nState of California \nReport No. 23135188.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \n \nSH0069 - BALINGER, JASON \nCanine Admin \n \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \n \n08/19/2023 21:25:48 \n \n \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH2821 \nPrinted: August 25, 2023 - 2:53 PM \n \n \nway into the crowd. Based upon the fact the call originated because Iban was being aggressive to \nresidents, reportedly had a gun and was hitting cars, I worried he might attack anyone of the onlookers or \npotentially take them hostage. Further, if Iban reached the crowd, my force options to subdue him would \nbe greatly limited because they might put others at risk of injury. Because of this, I believed I had to stop \nhim before he got to me and certainly before he reached the crowd. Not wanting to go hands on with a \npotentially armed person, I believed the safest way of stopping Iban was to deploy Nike. No other force \noption I had at my disposal would allow me to do so, without sacrificing the safety of distance or \ncompromising my chances of success. I believed deploying Nike would likely prevent Iban from reaching \nfor a weapon or at least make it more challenging for him to manipulate one and prevent him from \nreaching me or getting to the crowd. \n \nI removed Nike's traffic lead and released my grip on his collar, giving him the command to bite \nZachariah Iban. Nike ran at Iban, jumped and bit him on the inside of his upper, right arm. As Nike bit \nIban, I ordered him to get on the ground. I drew my pistol and began walking at Iban, pointing my gun at \nhim to be better prepared, should he produce a weapon. I continued to order Iban onto the ground and \nhe sat down. Iban was holding Nike's front, right leg with his left hand and had his right arm around the \nback of Nike's neck. Iban responded to my commands to get on the ground, saying, \"Okay,\" and laid on \nhis right side. With Iban showing signs of compliance, both lying down and replying okay to my \ncommands, I believed it was safe to holster and detain him. Further, with Iban lying on his back and \nmoving to his side, I had more time to scan his body for weapons and did not see any. I put my gun away \nand grasped Iban's left hand, requesting the officers move in to assists by calling out, \"Hands.\" The \nofficers ran up and took control of Iban's left hand. I informed them not to grab his right arm and moved \naround to gain physical control of Nike. As I grasped Nike's collar with my left hand, I could see the \nofficers had sufficient control of Iban, so I used my break stick to release Nike from the bite. Nike \ninstantly released his grasp of Iban and I stepped back. The officers detained Iban in handcuffs and \nchecked him for weapons. I later reviewed my body worn camera and found Nike was actively biting \nZachariah Iban for approximately 16 seconds.  \n \nI returned to my patrol car and placed Nike in the back seat.  \n \nI asked the officers if they had requested paramedics respond to evaluate Zachariah Iban's injuries and \nthey informed me they had.  \n \nI used my vehicle's radio and requested Sheriff's Communications inform the Lakeside Substation's \nsupervisor of the canine contact. Sergeant Serrato #4079 acknowledged the notification.  \n \nAmerican Medical Response's Medic 419 arrived on scene and the paramedics began evaluating \nZachariah Iban.  \n \nSergeant Carrillo #2821 of the Sheriff's Division of Inspectional Services contacted me by phone.

There were numerous small \nlacerations around Iban's upper arm with one larger laceration on the inside. The larger laceration was \napproximately three inches in length. Most of the lacerations had been closed with sutures.  \n \nI spoke to hospital staff and they informed me Iban had ten lacerations and was given 18 sutures.  \n \nWhile standing in the hallway of the emergency room, Zachariah Iban got my attention. He informed me \nhe was sorry for his actions, repeating his apology multiple times. I accepted his apology, telling him I did \nnot take his actions personally, but appreciated the gesture.  \n \nSergeant Serrato interviewed Zachariah Iban, asking questions about the utilization of a Sheriff's canine. \nSee Sergeant Serrato's report for further.  \n \nOfficer Garcia informed me she was going to book Zachariah Iban for residential burglary, resisting arrest \nand the probation violation warrant.

Extracted data provided to\nDetective Gragg and has yet to be reviewed.\nSummary of Incident:\nOn 10/01/23 at approximately 0741 hours, Community Service Officer (CSO) Graham was in the area\nof 3rd Street and A. Street, Antioch, when he located a vehicle (White Chevrolet Monte Carlo\n) he believed was possibly stolen. lt should be known Community Service Officers are\nunarmed lt should also be noted, CSO Graham was the officer who imlial/y took the report for the\nstolen vehicle he located on this morning. The vehicle was parked under an apartment carport and\nhad a tarp concealing a majority of the vehicle. Next to the Chevrolet Monte Carlo was a blue colored\nvan parked backwards in the parking stall directly next to and west of the stolen vehicle. A record\ncheck confirmed the vehicle\n) was stolen on 9/26123 APD#23-7303. CSO Graham recalled\na blue van was captured on video surveillance being used topush the stolen vehicle out ofthe storage\nyard CSO Graham reviewed this video captured on his BWC which he uploadedto evidence.com and\ndetermined the van appearedsimilarto the van usedto stealthe Monte Carlo on 9/26/23.\nCSO Graham requested APO uniformed officers respond and assist in the investigation.\nWhen uniformed officers arrived, they peered inside the van from the outside and discovered a subject\nwas sleeping in the back area of the van with a gun next to him. Officer Marques reported the\ndiscovery over the radio and backed off the vehicle to a safe area. While assessing the scene for a\nfew minutes from a short distance, the subject awoke, got into the driver's seat of the van, and\naccelerated forward, narrowly missing Ofc. Marques' vehicle. lt should be noted, Ofc. Marques was\nstanding in the area of his open driver's side door, and quickly retreated to the rear of his vehicle as\nthe suspect prepared to drive forward. Prior to retreating, Ofc. Marques and Ofc. Dibble yelled to the\nsuspect to not move and announced themselves as \"Antioch Police\". The suspect, later identified as O\naniel MACKIN, disregarded officers' commands and recklessly drove his vehicle forward with his\nhead below the dashboard, presumably unable to see what was forward of him and in his path.\nMACKIN drove the vehicle forward through the small apartment complex parking lot, drove over a\nsmall median, collided with a utility box and became stuck. MACKIN continued to accelerate,\nREPORTING OFFICER SIGNATURE/ DATE\nAdam Duffy #5609 Oct 23, 2023 13:48 (e-signature)\nPRINT NAME\nAdam Duffy #5609\nAntioch Police Department\n300 L ST\nI ANTIOCH, CA 94509\nMark43RMS Form v2.0generatedbyA OulfttifnJ/14 #5833 on Oc/ 24, 2023 15:21.\nSUPERVISOR SIGNATURE/ DATE\nJames Colley #4705 Oct 24, 2023 14:57 (e-signature)\nPRINT NAME\n.

As MACKIN was attempting to continue to flee in\nhis vehicle, Ofc. Mulholland utilized the 40mm less lethal launcher in an attempt to break a window(s)\nfor the purpose of de-escalation and/or disarm MACKIN. The 40mm was deployed five times but\nyielded no effect other than breaking the driver's side mirror. Four 40mm fired cartridges were later\nlocatedby the Contra Costa County Crime Laboratory. The 40mm fired cartridges were photographed\nand collectedas evidence.\nAs officers continued to yell verbal commands to MACKIN (approximately five and a half minutes) to\nelicit a safe surrender, he opened the sliding passenger side door of the van and ran from the vehicle,\nwith a gun in his right hand. As MACKIN ran eastbound on A. Street, Ofc. Marques deployed his K9,\nbut the K9 redirected to MACKIN's dog which was running with/alongside him. The K9 deployment\nwas unsuccessful. During the short foot pursuit, MACKIN on at least two occasions (according to\nBWC footage), partially turned his body/face to officers and leveled his gun in their direction. Officers\nfired several shots at MACKIN, striking him at least one time which caused him to initially fall to the\nground. MACKIN with the gun still in his hand, got to his feet and continued to run eastbound. Officers\nfired additional shots toward MACKIN before MACKIN pitched the gun to his left before collapsing to\nthe ground. After MACKIN discarded his weapon, no officers fired their weapons. Officers quickly\nplaced him in custody and rendered medical aid. According to hospital staff at JMMC, MACKIN\nsustained one gunshot wound which passed through both lungs and exited his body. At the time of\nthis writing his medical record(s) has not been obtained.\nAccording to officers, MACKIN did not speak or acknowledge them the entirety of the incident.\nInvestigators located the firearm pitched by MACKIN, on the northern sidewalk of A. Street and in the\narea of his flight path. The firearm (Serial # AEP3646) was discovered to be a Smith and Wesson .38\nrevolver. The revolver was fully loaded with six unfired rounds in the cylinder. The firearm appeared to\nbe operational. The Contra Costa County Forensics Laboratory laterprocessed the firearm for latent\nprints and DNA. No latentprints were recoveredfrom the firearm. DNA swabs werepreservedforlater\ntesting upon request The firearm hadno record ofregistered owner. The CCCDA performeda trace\nofthe firearm, howeverat the time ofthis writing, results are not available.\nThe Contra Costa County Crime Laboratory located/collected thirty (30) fired 9mm casings.

The charges listed on the Ramey warrant were for PC187 (APD#23-003219).\nA criminal history check revealed prior felony convictions prohibiting him from owning/possessing a\nfirearm/ammunition.\nA preliminary search of the suspects' van was conducted after a search warrant was granted. During\nthe preliminary search, a license plate from the stolen vehicle was located wedged between the back\nof the driver's seat and pet kennel.\nThe incident was captured on BWC and Dash Camera video.\nREPORTING OFFICER SIGNATURE/ DATE\nAdam Duffy #5609 Oct 23, 2023 13:48 (e-signature)\nPRINT NAME\nAdam Duffy #5609\nAntioch Police Department\n300 L ST\nI ANTIOCH, CA 94509\nMark43 RMSForm v2.0generatedbyA Quin/anilla #5833 on Oc/ 24, 2023 15:21.\n¡ SUPERVISOR SIGNATURE/ DATE\n: James Colley #4705 Oct 24, 2023 14:57 (e-signature)\ni PRINT NAME\n1 James Colley #4705\nPg 3 of 118\nReport# 23-007441 - Case Report Report Antioch Police Department\nPg 4 of 118\nNo eyewitnesses were located and one (1) individual who heard the incident provided a brief\nstatement to investigators.\nNotification:\nOn October 1st, 2023, at approximately 0830 hours,\nI was notified while off-duty and at my home by\nInvestigations Lieutenant Martin of an officer involved shooting.

Um, and then there was the van that he said was responsible - possibly responsible veh\nicle, um, associated with the stealing of that vehicle, because it was pushed out of the lot at - uh,\nI belie\nve he said it was CubeSmart Storage. (Unintelligible) a little snippet or video, or not a video, it was a pi\ncture, a screenshot of the picture of the vehicle pushing the stolen vehicle, um, the van. So we get ther\ne, they confirmed that.\nI see there's somebody inside the van,\nI look inside the van and\nI see a gun right\nnext to where the subject is laying. Um, so we - we -\nI said, \"Hey he's got a gun. Gun.\" So\nI know we ta\nctfully retreated back to our vehicles, because he was sleeping, and\nI don't know if he's gonna grab this\ngun or what he's gonna do with this. Um,\nI put it over the radio, um, and then more units arrived, whoev\ner was on duty that day. Um, a short time after that, um, we started tryin' to, like, come up with some ki\nnd of plan, what we're doin', who's talking, who's doing the talking. And then we started talking.\nI don't\nknow if commands were already given at that point, but then you could see a lot of movement in the va\nn, like he - he was moving around. Um, the van is just kind of shaking back and forth. Um, there's like a\nlittle -\nI don't know if it was like a shade, or something in the middle of the van that covers the front win\ndshield, or the front to where the back part is.\nQ: Like a curtain?\nA: Like a curtain, yeah, in between. Um, so\nI saw that kinda move, and I kind of just see the head pop,\nand\nI see eyes, and\nI see the steering wheel move. And the next thing you know, hey, he started the v\nan. (Unintelligible) get here, start - tryin' to start the van. The van starts and he's not coming up to actu\nally drive the vehicle, but you see, um, the steering wheel move. And then at some point, um, I'm thinki\nng that he's gonna to hit me, 'cause the - the way my car was positioned, he was coming straight at me\nif he woulda moved the vehicle. And then he ended up moving the vehicle, not even sitting in the driver\n's seat, and then almost hit my vehicle. And I'm goin' around 'cause\nI didn't want to get hit by the vehicle\nwhen\nI was, um, outside of my vehicle, basically using my vehicle as cover.\nI didn't wanna get hit by the\nvehicle. So he goes -\nI don't know if at that point\nI grabbed my dog out at that point or not, or if it was\nbef- before he took off or not.\nI know\nI grabbed my k- uh, (Kato) out of the car a couple times.\nI think\nI t\noak him out, put him in, took him out, put him in. Um, he goes forward, almost hits my vehicle. Goes and\ngets stuck in a little berm or a little I, um -\nI don't know what they call that right there, but a little center\nmedian that was there. He gets stuck there. We're giving him commands to stop, um, you know, you\nknow, \"Stop right there.\" We end up saying that, you know, (unintelligible) you take over commands be\ncause he is CNT trained. So usually what we do as far as if he's on the call, he usually deals with talking\nbecause he is CNT. Van continues to go back and forth, back and forth. She's tr- he gets stuck, contin\nues to try to go back and forth, um, wheels are spinning sup- and not gaining traction or anything. Um,\nhe - and I'm thinking he's gonna back up, and he -\nI don't know, he's not looking where he's backing up\nto, because he didn't - when he went forward, he wasn't looking. So I'm thinking he's not looking where\nhe's goin'. And I'm tryin' to move my car, but there's a car -\nI know there's a car behind me,\nI see it in the\nrear - in the rearview that there's a car behind me. So\nI really had nowhere to go with my vehicle. So\nI\ndon't know,\nI think at that point\nI put the dog back in the car, and then I think\nI got him back out again.\nAnd then\nI tried to move around another vehicle, um, and then he had stopped. (Unintelligible) the\nvan, we can't see inside the van, because the windows are really dark. And he's movin' a lot. We don't\nknow - he's got this gun, we can't see him. He can see us, but we can't see him movin' inside his van.\nUm, and that happened a couple times as far as him moving around in the van. Um, then we tried to use\na 40 millimeter and break out the windows. Tried to do, like, a barricaded subject inside there, and may\nbe throw some OCs, um, uh, 40 millimeter rounds, if there were -\nI didn't know if we had any or not at t\nhat point. But, um, they were trying to break the windows out, but it just deflected off the windows.

And just walk me through the incident from beginning to end.\nA: Okay. Um, cleared briefing and got dispatched to, um, an alarm at Walmart. Uh, Officer Marques was\nmy cover.\nI went to Walmart and dispo'd that call out. Um, eso Graham (unintelligible) call for service,\num, and they had sent Officer Marques. And as\nI closed my call-out from Walmart, they attached me to\nthe call downtown. Um,\nI drove downtown. Um,\nI was gonna - because of the limited information\nI want\ned to -\nI saw that off-, uh, eso Graham was staged,\nI think it was Third and D\nI think if I recall correctly\n. Um, because of the limited information\nI wanted to go 98 with - meet with him prior to gain' on scene.\nUm, but by the time\nI got down - downtown Officer Marques and eso Graham were, um, already on\nthe call, um, at the scene. Um, upon my arrival, um,\nI parked behind both of their vehicles. Um, walked\nup to the possible stolen vehicle that was under the tarp. Um,\nI recall\nI picked up the back of the tarp w\nhere the plate shoulda been. There was no plate. Um, the van was backed in right next to it on the -\nI\nguess it would be west side directly next to that white car. Um, there were multiple dogs inside of the v\nan. You can see what looked like a leg kind of in the back of the van on\nI don't know if it was a bench s\neat or what. But you could tell someone appeared to be laying inside of it. Uh, there was two bungee\nlike bungee cords underneath holdin' the tarp down on the car. Um, so because there was no plate,\nI u\nndid those bungees to get over to the vent on the windshield. Um, upon doing that\nI know eso Graham\nI think\nI can't remember if he tripped the VIN or asked for the last four or something. But he confirmed t\nhat that was a stolen car. Um,\nI think at one point,\nI saw -\nI can't remember if I saw the person in the van\nmoving or if it was the dogs. But\nI think\nI waved, like, come out to talk to us. Uh, myself and Officer Mar\nques kinda walked over the van to try and make contact at that point. Um, Officer Marques went to the\nwindow and that was when he said that there was a revolver.\nI think he said silver revolver next to the\n- the suspect sleeping. Um, at that point\nI initiated my body cam and retreated back to - it was the eso\nExplorer, uh, and asked for additional units. Um,\nI know\nI put out -\nI think -\nI believe\nI put out that there\nwas a gun.\nI know Marques also put out there was a gun in the vehicle to let the other officers know.\nUm, and\nI initiated the lights on the eso Explorer. Um,\nI think the first time\nI did it,\nI didn't trigger him all\nthe way to activate the dash cam. And when\nI realized that,\nI reached back in and, um, initiated the ors\ntarted the dash cam at that point. Um, kinda at that point believed he was still - the suspect was still asl\neep. So it kinda slowed things down. Um, took cover and Officer Marques was on his driver's side of his\nvehicle. Um, and at that point, it was just my thought process was slow things down, wait for additional\nunits 'cause there's only two of us - well two officers at that point. Um,\nI think Officer Mulholland arrived\nnext with his trainee if I recall correctly. Um, and\nI know -\nI think he had got or mentioned grabbing the\n40- mil millimeter -- excuse me -- um, as a form of less lethal 'cause\nI didn't have one.\nI don't know if Of\nficer Marques had one at that point. Mine was still in the car. Um,\nI think Officer Marques or\nMulholland -- I'm not sure which one -- started giving commands 'cause they were on the other side oft\nhe car. Um, at that point\nI think\nI saw the suspect's arm --\nI don't think I'd seen his head yet -- reaching\nup by the steering wheel of the blue van and the van had started. Um,\nI remember at that point kind of\neverybody started giving commands.\nI don't remember specifically what\nI said.\nI think it was just, \"Shut\nREPORTING OFFICER SIGNATURE / DATE\nAdam Duffy #5609 Oct 23, 2023 13:48 (e-signature)\nPRINT NAME\nAdam Duffy #5609\nAntioch Police Department\n300 L ST\nI ANTIOCH.

Um, and in the midst of that the suspect started the van. Um, and he -\nI think he drove ont\nhe east side of Officer Marques's vehicle. Um, jumped up onto the curb into kind of a planter, median si\ndewalk area, um, and hit somethin' that prevented him from going forward. A that point we kinda re-\npositioned. Um,\nI know at that point\nI ran over to my car, which was parked behind the CSO Explorer a\nnd Officer Marques's vehicle. Um, and\nI was at\nI think the front of my car behind the engine, uh, contin\nuing to give commands. Suspect had put the vehicle - it looked like he was puttin' it in drive and reverse\ntryin' to get unstuck numerous times, um, and just rewing the engine 'cause it wasn't goin' anywhere.\nAnd then at one point he - you could see there was curtains in the back of the van on all the windows so\nyou couldn't really see fully inside of it. Um, but there were some gaps and you can see him - the susp\nect gain' from driver's seat to the back of the vehicle, um, back and forth numerous times. Um,\nI didn't li\nke where\nI was positioned, um, and also Officer Mulholland had ran outta 40 millimeters at that point.\nAnd\nI knew\nI still had my 40 millimeter and extra rounds in the - the back of my car. And\nI ended up gai\nng to the back pillar of my car to -\nI can't remember if I personally opened up the back to let Officer\nMulholland get the extra rounds out of my 40-mil or if he opened it. But\nI ended up at the back of my ca\nr. Um, where he proceeded to shoot more 40s to try and\nI th- my understanding was to try and break the\nfront driver window, um, which was unsuccessful after numerous attempts. Uh, Lieutenant Fortner had\nshowed up in the middle of all that at some point. And asked if we had had a shield, which none of us d\nid. Um,\nI remember he had brought a shield up to the back of my car where\nI was standing. Um, and ki\nnd of simultaneously it seemed like, from what\nI recall, the suspect had taken off on foot out of the pas\nsenger side of the vehicle. Which\nI didn't have visual of but\nI heard them yelling - other officers yelling t\nhat he had started takin' off running.\nI think\nI ran to the front of the van and around the van to go\nI guess\nit'd be southbound on the extension onto A street. Um, if I recall,\nI think at that point the K-9 was deplo\nyed, um, to a suspect who was running across the street to the east curb line or east sidewalk. Um, as\nI\nwas making my way that way,\nI know\nI heard rounds going off. Um,\nI don't know which two officers were\nahead of me.\nI don't - can't remember if it was Officer Borg or Marques, but there were two officers kind\nof ahead of me, in between me and suspect's position.\nI see 'em running. Um,\nI eventually caught up to\nthose two officers. Um, and suspect turned and pointed the firearm in our direction. Um, at that point\nI r\necall stepping kind of offline away from the other officers and that was when\nI discharged my firearm.\nUm, suspect continued to run a short distance if I recall correctly and he threw the gun. And then\nI rem\nember\nI think a short distance later is where he - he had fallen in the middle of the - the road. Um,\nI we\nnt up.\nI cuffed the sus-\nI put -\nI handcuffed the suspect. Excuse me. Um,\nI observed obviously numerous\ngunshot wounds. So\nI immediately started cuttin' his clothes off to try and render aid. Um, some of the\nmed bags had arrived.\nI can't remember how or who brought 'em. Um, at one point we'd ran out of the\nsupplies. So\nI knew\nI personally had two of my own med bags in my car. So\nI ran back to my car that w\nas parked at the scene where the van and the car were. And by the time\nI had grabbed my med bags a\nnd ran back, uh, Fire had already arrived on scene. And that was kind of -\nI remained on scene just be\ncause of scene security and lack of officers, um, until\nI was given a ride back to the PD.\nQ: Okay.

Seven Speer 9 mm \ncasings were located west of the southbound bike lane of M Street.  One bullet strike was found at 559 \nCollins Drive, #2 (this is an upstairs apartment).  The casings and bullet fragments were logged into \nevidence by CSRT. \n \nBODY WORN CAMERA FOOTAGE  \n \nOfficer Wilkins and Officer Kusumo were wearing Body Worn Cameras (BWC) during this incident.  \nThe following is a sequence of still photos taken from Officer Wilkins’ BWC.   \n \n \n \nThe time of this still photo is 01:00:01.  Garibay walked towards Officer Wilkins as Officer Wilkins \nstepped out of his patrol vehicle.  Garibay had the knife in his right hand. \n \n \n \nPage 9 \nGaribay opening the folding knife. \n \n \n \nWithin one second of the last still photo, Officer Wilkins drew his firearm.  Officer Wilkins told Garibay \nto “Drop that, drop that knife now.”  In my estimation Garibay was within 10 feet of Officer Wilkins at \nthis point.   \n \n \n \nPage 10 \n \nAt 01:00:14, Garibay said, “Shoot me” and advanced towards Officer Kusumo. \n \nGaribay changed his advancement towards Officer Wilkins.  By this time Officer Wilkins had ordered \nGaribay to “drop the knife” seven times.  Officer Kusumo told Garibay to “drop it” five times and “drop \nthe knife” two additional times.   \n \n \n \nPage 11 \n \nGaribay told the officers “Shoot me” three separate times.  Officer Wilkins and Officer Kusumo \ncontinued to tell Garibay to “drop the knife.”   \n \n \nAt 01:00:44, Officer Wilkins announced, “You’re going to get shot, stop.”  In my assessment Garibay \nwas steadily walking faster towards Officer Wilkins and an eminent threat to stab Officer Wilkins.    \n \n \n \nPage 12 \n \nAt 01:00:46, Garibay fell to the ground after Officer Wilkins fired four shots and Officer Kusumo fired \nthree shots in Garibay’s direction.     \n \n \nWhen Officer Wilkins moved Garibay to provide medical aid, the handle of the knife could be seen. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 14 \n \nOfficer Kusumo fired her first shot; muzzle flash can be seen at 01:00:43. \n \n \nOfficer Kusumo fired her second shot and muzzle flash can be seen.  Garibay can be seen falling \nforward.  The BWC does not clearly show Officer Kusumo’s third shot, however it can be heard.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 15 \nVIDEO FROM OTHER LOCATION (\n \n \n \nThis video clip (which also contains audio) is approximately 21 seconds in duration.  \n held his cell \nphone outside the driver’s side window of his vehicle and filmed the incident.  Both Officer Wilkins and \nOfficer Kusumo can be heard saying “Drop the knife” several times.  This video had better lighting than \nthe BWC footage and it could be seen that both the officers and Garibay move closer to \n  Officer \nWilkins can be heard stating, “You’re going to get shot, stop.”  Officer Kusumo is heard stating, \n“crossfire” and then a large volley of gun shots.  This concluded \n video.            \n \nDOJ PHYSICAL EVIDENCE EXAMINATION \n \nAt the date of this report, physical evidence examination from the Department of Justice is still pending.  \nEvidence items such as bullets, officers’ pistols, spent casings, Garibay’s knife, and a DNA card were \nsent by Detective Rocha to the Department of Justice.  The outcome of the examination will not affect \nthe analysis in this report.   \n \nINVOLVED OFFICER STATEMENTS  \n \nOfficer Brandon Wilkins and Officer Kusumo declined to give voluntary statements to MPD detectives.   \n \nOFFICER WILKINS’ ROUND COUNT \n \nOn October 26, 2023, at 0323 hours, Detective Rocha and Detective Lupian conducted a round count of \nOfficer Wilkins’ firearm.  Officer Wilkins had a Sig Sauer P320 9mm (serial number 58H267387).  \nThere were 17 live rounds in magazine #1 and 1 live round chambered for a total of 18 rounds.  The \ncapacity of magazine #1 is 21 rounds.  Fully loaded, Officer Wilkins’ firearm holds 22 rounds. The \nnumber of rounds remaining in the firearm is consistent with the evidence showing he fired at Garibay a \ntotal of four times. No rounds were missing from Officer Wilkins’ remaining two magazines.    \n \nOFFICER KUSUMO’S ROUND COUNT \n \nOn October 26, 2023, at 0353 hours, Detective Rocha and Detective Lupian conducted a round count of \nOfficer Kusumo’s firearm.  Officer Kusumo had a department issued Simth and Wesson M&P 9mm \n(serial number HDW1855).  There were 14 live rounds in magazine #1 and 1 live round chambered for a \ntotal of 15 rounds.  The capacity of magazine #1 is 17 rounds.  Fully loaded, Officer Kusumo’s firearm \nholds 18 rounds. The number of rounds remaining in the firearm is consistent with the evidence showing \nshe fired at Garibay a total of three times. No rounds were missing from Officer Kusumo’s remaining \ntwo magazines.    \n \nWITNESS STATEMENTS \n \nGilbert Garibay’s grandson, \n told MPD Officer Chavez that Gilbert left their house \naround 0100 hours.  \n went to look for Garibay around 0130 hours, because he had not come \nhome.  \n found the officers on M Street and told Officer Chavez that his grandfather was diabetic.  \nOfficer Chavez did not tell \n that his grandfather was shot by officers.     \n \nGilbert Garibay’s daughter, \n told Detective Rocha that her father never gets up to take a \nwalk.  \n explained that her father took blood thinners, had a stint, and had a balloon in his heart \n \n \nPage 16 \nfrom a prior heart attack.  \n did state that she lived in a separate house from her parents.  Gilbert’s \nwife, \n was also present while \n spoke to Detective Rocha.  \n stated Gilbert had \nwoken up two nights prior and stated, “somebody was coming to get him.”  \n said Gilbert also said \nsomebody in the family was going to “get him” and “everybody knew about it.”  \n did not know \nwhat Gilbert was talking about.  Both \n and \n explained that Gilbert lived in fear. \n \n said since Gilbert’s change in behavior he felt he needed to have a weapon.  \n told Detective \nRocha that Gilbert had a lot of knives.  On the night of this incident, Gilbert gave \n all his money \nand debit card before they went to bed together.  Detective Rocha asked \n if Gilbert had ever given \nher his money and debit card before and \n said, “No.”  None of the family members interviewed said \nGilbert had a history of mental health problems.     \n \nAUTOPSY \n \nOn October 27, 2023, Forensic Pathologist Sam Andrews with NAAG Forensic PC performed an \nautopsy on Gilbert Garibay at the Merced County Sheriff’s Office Coroners Facilility.  Dr. Andrews \ndetermined the cause of the death to be “gunshot wounds.”  In addition, the other significant \ncontributory cause(s) of death were “atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.”   \n \nGaribay had gunshot wounds to his neck, two to the right side of this chest, right shoulder, right thigh, \nlower right leg, lower left leg, and a graze gunshot wound to the right side of his face.  The gunshot \nwound to Garibay’s neck caused major injuries to the thyroid gland, trachea, esophagus, spinal cord, \nthoracic vertebrae, and left lung.  The gunshot wounds to Garibay’s upper right chest caused injuries to \nhis right lung, right clavicle, right ribs, and right arm.  The gunshot wounds to Garibay’s legs were soft \ntissue injuries only. \n \nDr. Andrews’s incidental findings revealed enlargement of the heart; “moderate hardening and \nnarrowing in the stented region of the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle, a single \ngallstone, and “enlargement and nodularity of the prostate gland.”   \n \nTOXICOLOGY \n \nToxicology tests revealed Garibay’s blood was negative for ethanol and drugs.   \n \nCONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT \n \nNo prior law enforcement contacts were located.  Furthermore, there was no exact match found when \nrunning a criminal history on Gilbert Garibay. \n \nINVESTIGATOR NELSON’S TRAINING AND EXPERENCE WITH EDGED WEAPONS \n \nThroughout my 25 years as a law enforcement officer, I have received ongoing firearm and defensive \ntactic training.  It has been consistently taught to me that edged weapon attacks are highly fatal.  In \naddition, a subject with an edged weapon has the ability to close the distance of 21 feet before I can \nidentify the threat, make a decision and react properly with deadly force.      \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 17 \nAPPLICABLE LAW \n \nCalifornia Penal Code, Section 196 details the circumstances when a public officer’s intentional killing of \nanother is justified.  CALCRIM 507, a jury instruction, uses plain language to describe the elements of \nPenal Code, Section 196, stating:  \n \n. . . if he killed someone while acting as a public officer. . . [s]uch a killing is justified, and \ntherefore not unlawful, if: \n1.  The [person who killed another] was a public officer; \n2.  The killing was committed while overcoming actual resistance to some legal process or \nwhile performing any other legal duty; \n3.  The killing was necessary to accomplish one of those lawful purposes; \n \nAND \n \n4.  The [public officer] had probable cause to believe that the decedent posed a threat of \ndeath or great bodily injury, either to the [public officer] or to others or that [the \ndecedent] had committed (insert applicable crime here) and that crime threatened the \n[public officer] or others with death or great bodily injury. \n \nA person has probable cause to believe that someone poses a threat of death or great bodily \ninjury when facts known to the person would persuade someone of reasonable caution that \nthe other person is going to cause death or great bodily injury to another. \n* * * \nGreat bodily injury means significant or substantial physical injury.  It is an injury that is \ngreater than minor or moderate harm. \n \nThe People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not \njustified.  If the People have not met this burden, [a jury] must find the [public officer] not \nguilty of murder or manslaughter.  (As was intended by the authors, the language above \nwas modified or removed to correspond to the circumstances of this case.  Changes are \nshown in [brackets].  The full text of CALCRIM 507 is attached in the appendix.)  \n \nA peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe a person has committed a public offense or is a danger \nto others may use reasonable force to detain or arrest the person, to prevent the person’s escape, or to \novercome the person’s resistance.  (California Penal Code, Section 835a; CALCRIM 2670.)  An officer \nwho detains or arrests a person does not need to retreat or stop his or her efforts if the person resists or \nthreatens resistance.  Moreover, using reasonable force does not make the officer an aggressor or cause \nhim or her to lose the right to self-defense.  (California Penal Code, Section 835a.)  The person being \ndetained or arrested has a duty to permit himself or herself to be detained, and the person must refrain \nfrom using force or any weapon to resist arrest.  (People v. Allen (1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 981, 985; \nCalifornia Penal Code, Section 834a; CALCRIM 2670, 2671, 2672.) \nA peace officer may use deadly force under circumstances where it is reasonably necessary for self-\ndefense or defense of another.  (California Penal Code, Sections, 196 and 197.)  California law permits \nthe use of deadly force if the person actually and reasonable believed he/she or another was in imminent \ndanger of death or great bodily injury.  It is the reasonable appearance of danger to the officer and his/her \n \n \nPage 18 \nhonest belief in that danger which is controlling.  If an officer actually believes that deadly force is \nnecessary and that belief is reasonable under the circumstances, the officer’s actions are lawful even if it \nis later determined that the danger did not actually exist.  (CALCRIM 505, 507; People v. Toledo (1948) \n85 Cal.App.2d 577; People v. Jackson (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 639.)  Further, the officer need not prove \nthat he/she had the right to use deadly force. Rather, it is the prosecution which must prove that the officer \ndid not have that right.",

My uniform consisted of a Navy-blue long sleeve shirt with a “City of Reedley Police” patch and \nblue/gold chevrons on each arm. On the left breast of my shirt is a gold-colored badge and the right is a gold name \ntag and a department issued body worn camera (BWC). I was wearing a pair of clear prescription glasses. I was \nwearing a black leather duty belt, navy blue pants and black boots. I was driving Reedley PD unit 713, which has a \ntraditional black and white color pattern and is fully marked with red and blue emergency lights.\nOfficers were dispatched to \n \n for a reporting party stating that they were advised to \ncall police if Ernesto Carrillo (9/17/86) returned to the residence. Ernesto was last seen wearing a gray shirt, blue \njeans and a red baseball hat. I recalled being briefed at the start of my shift, which occurred around 1900 hours, that \nErnesto had vandalized his girlfriend’s vehicle and fled prior to officers arriving. I was further advised that he had an \nactive and confirmed felony warrant for PC 273.5 and PC 236, and was yet to be arrested. I recalled a specific case \nfrom about a month earlier where Ernesto had assaulted his girlfriend at the Edgewater Inn in Reedley. I \nremembered that incident due to the numerous times he was arrested for felony and misdemeanor domestic violence \nand for violating restraining orders. I was able to see his criminal history when I was reviewing the officers report \nfrom the assault at the Edgewater Inn. I could not remember the last time I had seen so many arrests for domestic \nviolence by one person. I believed that Ernesto had a propensity for violence based off of his criminal history and \nbased off of his habitual drug use.\nPrior to responding, I called dispatch via phone and confirmed the felony warrant was active. Shortly after hanging \nup, I received a photograph of Ernesto from dispatch.\nI activated my department issued BWC prior to arriving on scene. When I arrived on scene, prior to exiting my patrol \nvehicle, I heard officers advise that Ernesto had left the apartment prior to our arrival. State Center Community \nCollege District (SCCCD) Police Officer Serrano asked over the Reedley PD radio channel to confirm the subjects \nname of who we were looking for. Officer Serrano was advised it was Ernesto Carrillo and he stated that he had just \ncontacted him in the Reedley College parking lot, for further refer to SCCCD report number 23-564.\nWhile responding to the area Officer Serrano stated that Ernesto was in the front yard of a residence with a white \npicket fence on Reed Ave. in the area of Kip Patrick Ave. As I was driving towards that intersection, Officer Serrano \nadvised that Ernesto was south of Kip Patrick Ave. on Reed Ave. I believed that Ernesto was still going to be on the \neast side of Reed Ave. when either myself or another officer would contact him. I requested an officer go to \nRiverview Ave. south of Kip Patrick Ave. in case Ernesto ran east bound from Reed Ave. I believed that Ernesto \nwould run based off a prior radio transmission from Officer Cardinalle regarding Ernesto running and the severity of \nthe warrant for his arrest. I wanted a perimeter set up quickly in case he fled, because I did not want him to escape. I \nfeared that if he escaped, the female who was the victim of the felony assault and false imprisonment, may be at risk \nof retaliation from Ernesto if she called.\nREPORT DATE / TIME\nAug 21, 2023 21:02\nEVENT START DATE / TIME - EVENT END DATE / TIME\nAug 19, 2023 21:50 - Aug 20, 2023 11:26\nPRIMARY REPORTER\nSTEVEN PURYEAR #L082\nREPORT DESCRIPTION\nAssisting narrative\nSUPPLEMENT TYPE\nAssisting narrative\nPg  of \n2\n3\nReport # 23-0002747 - Supplemental - B Report Reedley PD\nPg  of \n2\n3\nReedley PD\nMark43 RMS Form v2.0 generated by P.

When I turned southbound, \nI observed a moderate amount of traffic on the roadway. Along the roadway are streetlights that artificially light the \narea. Some areas are dimly lit and others are moderately lit. I drove approximately 50 yards and Officer Serrano \nadvised me that Ernesto was to the left of my unit.\nI briefly stopped and turned to contact a subject on the east sidewalk of Reed Ave. and did not recognize the subject \nfrom the photograph as Ernesto. Officer Serrano stated that subject I was going to contact was not Ernesto. As I \nturned and drove my unit south on Reed Ave. Officer Serrano advised he had his spotlight on Ernesto and he was \nrunning south bound. I observed Ernesto running southbound approximately 50 yards south of me on the east \nsidewalk of Reed Ave.. I activated my overhead emergency code 3 lights and my siren. My patrol vehicle was in the \nnorth and southbound lane of Reed Ave and approximately 25 yards from Ernesto. Ernesto hands were swinging \nfrom front to back above his waist as he was running. I observed his right hand to be empty. As his left hand was \nbrought back, as he was running, his left hand had a silver somewhat reflective object protruding from his hand. At \nthe time, I believed the object could possibly be a firearm or knife. While he was running Ernesto was illuminated by \npassing vehicles headlights and turning his head over his right shoulder looking in my direction.\nI passed at least one, possibly two vehicles and drove almost parallel to Ernesto along the east curb of S. Reed Ave. \nAs Ernesto was running, I could clearly see he was wearing baggy clothing that could easily conceal a weapon and \nhe was grabbing at his left pocket. I wanted to pull nearly parallel to Ernesto because I did not want him to run into \noncoming traffic, endangering himself and/or motorists. I had this in my mind at the time because of two separate \nbody cameras I had seen in the last month of subjects being hit by oncoming traffic while fleeing police. I rolled down \nthe driver side window of my patrol vehicle. My driver side mirror was approximately 3 yards behind Ernesto and 3 \nyards from his right side. I unholstered and activated my department issued Conducted Energy Device (CED). I told \nErnesto in a loud clear voice “Stop Police” but he continued running and looked over his shoulder and directly at me. \nI pointed my CED at Ernesto at some point after I rolled my driver side window down. I once again said, “Stop Police” \nin a loud clear voice and Ernesto continued running. At this point the area was dimly lit to me and I could not have a \nclear and uninterrupted view of Ernesto’s hands. I warned him \"You're gonna get tased\", and he did not stop. I \ndeployed my department issued CED and Ernesto’s feet came fully of the ground and he landed on the concrete with \nhis face and upper chest area.\nI stopped, put my patrol vehicle in park and exited my patrol vehicle as my department issued CED was completing \nits pre-set five second cycle. Once the CED was finished cycling, Ernesto sat up and I saw a large amount of blood \ndripping from his face and covering the sidewalk. I yelled at Ernesto to show me his hands, twice, which he did not \ncomply. I chose not to activate the CED again because of Ernesto’s injuries. As officers ran up to place Ernesto in \nhandcuffs, I requested EMS code 3 for Ernesto before the handcuffs were fully applied to his wrists. I requested EMS \ncode 3 due to Ernesto’s injuries to his head. Ernesto was making groaning noises, which I believed to be from pain \nhe was feeling. Within minutes Ernesto was talking to officers about the handcuffs being tight. During a search of \nErnesto, I observed officer Nava remove an object from Ernesto’s left pocket or waistband area. The object had a \nblack handle approximately four inches long and a silver piece of metal that protrude from the tool. When the object \nwas removed, I initially thought it was a “Zip gun”. A zip gun is a personally manufactured firearm from common \nitems. I then realized it was a “window punch”, which is a tool used to break car windows. I believe this item may \nhave been what Ernesto was running with but can not be certain, as I did not have a view of his left hand during the \nentire contact.\nI was also advised that Ernesto had a knife on him. I advised officers to place Ernesto on his side, to prevent him \nfrom aspirating blood from the facial trauma. Ernesto sat up and I believed allowing him to be in a position of comfort \nwould be most beneficial for him. I did instruct officers not to allow him to lay on his back. I was able to see that one \nprobe from the CED struck Ernesto on the back of his upper neck and the other on the right side of his lower back. \nDuring the call I photograph Ernesto and provided them to Officer Renteria to be attached to this report.\nPg  of \n3\n3\nReport # 23-0002747 - Supplemental - B Report Reedley PD\nPg  of \n3\n3\nReedley PD\nMark43 RMS Form v2.0 generated by P.

Exonerated \nSergeant Puryear was responding to a call for service where the suspect (Carrillo) has a \nhistory of domestic violence and had a confirmed felony warrant for PC 273.5 (A) and PC \n236. Carrillo was running from police and had something in his left hand that appeared to \nbe a weapon.

While there is no way to specify \nthe exact amount or type of reasonable force to be applied in any situation, every member of \nthis department is expected to use these guidelines to make such decisions in a professional, \nimpartial, and reasonable manner (Government Code § 7286). \nIn addition \nto those methods, techniques, and tools set forth below, the guidelines for the \nreasonable application of force contained \nin this policy shall apply to \nall policies addressing \nthe potential use of force, including but not limited to the Control Devices and Techniques and \nConducted Energy Device policies. \nRetaliation prohibitions for reporting suspected violations are addressed in the Anti-Retaliation \nPolicy. \n300.1.1 \nDEFINITIONS \nDefinitions related to this policy include: \nDeadly force - Any use of force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily \ninjury, including but not limited to the discharge of a firearm (Penal Code § 835a). \nFeasible \n- Reasonably capable \nof being done \nor carried out under the circumstances \nto \nsuccessfully achieve the arrest or lawful objective without increasing risk to the officer or another \nperson (Government Code § 7286(a)). \nForce - The application of physical techniques or tactics, chemical agents, or weapons to another \nperson. \nIt is not a use of force when a person allows him/herself to be searched, escorted, \nhandcuffed, or restrained. \nSerious bodily injury - A serious impairment of physical condition, including but not limited to \nthe following: loss of consciousness; concussion; bone fracture; protracted loss or impairment \nof function of any bodily member or organ; a wound requiring extensive suturing; and serious \ndisfigurement (Penal Code § 243(f)(4)). \nTotality of the circumstances - All facts known to the officer at the time, including the conduct \nof the officer and the subject leading up to the use of force (Penal Code § 835a). \n300.2 \nPOLICY \nThe use of force by law enforcement personnel is a matter of critical concern, both to the public \nand to the law enforcement community. Officers are involved on a daily basis in numerous and \nvaried interactions and, when warranted, may use reasonable force in carrying out their duties. \nOfficers must have an understanding of, and true appreciation for, their authority and limitations. \nThis is especially true with respect to overcoming resistance while engaged in the performance \nof law enforcement duties. \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 1 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nUse of Force \n  \nThe Agency recognizes and respects the value of all human life and dignity without prejudice to \nanyone. Vesting officers with the authority to use reasonable force and to protect the public welfare \nrequires monitoring, evaluation and a careful balancing of all interests. \n300.2.1 \nDUTY TO INTERCEDE \nAny officer present and observing another law enforcement officer or an employee using force \nthat is clearly beyond that which is necessary, as determined by an objectively reasonable officer \nunder the circumstances, shall, when in a position to do so, intercede (as defined by Government \nCode § 7286) to prevent the use of unreasonable force. \nWhen observing force used by a law enforcement officer, each officer should take into account \nthe totality of the circumstances and the possibility that other law enforcement officers may have \nadditional information regarding the threat posed by the subject (Government Code § 7286(b)). \n300.2.2 \nFAIR AND UNBIASED USE OF FORCE \nOfficers are expected to carry out their duties, including the use of force, in \na manner that is fair \nand unbiased (Government Code § 7286(b)). See the Bias-Based Policing Policy for additional \nguidance. \n300.2.3 \nDUTY TO REPORT EXCESSIVE FORCE \nAny officer who observes a law enforcement officer or an employee use force that potentially \nexceeds what the officer reasonably believes to be necessary shall immediately report these \nobservations to a supervisor (Government Code § 7286(b)). \nAs used in this subsection, \"immediately\" means as soon as it is safe and feasible to do so. \n300.2.4 \nFAILURE TO INTERCEDE \nAn officer who has received the required training on the duty to intercede and then fails to act to \nintercede when required by law, may be disciplined in the same manner as the officer who used \nforce beyond that which is necessary (Government Code § 7286(b)). \n300.3 \nUSE OF FORCE \nOfficers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary given the facts \nand totality of the circumstances known to or perceived by the officer at the time of the event to \naccomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose (Penal Code § 835a). \nThe reasonableness of force will be judged from the perspective of \na reasonable officer on the \nscene at the time of the incident. Any evaluation of reasonableness must allow for the fact that \nofficers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force that reasonably \nappears necessary in a particular situation, with limited information and in circumstances that are \ntense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving. \nGiven that no policy can realistically predict every possible situation an officer might encounter, \nofficers are entrusted to use well-reasoned discretion in determining the appropriate use of force in \neach incident. Officers may only use a level of force that they reasonably believe is proportional to \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 2 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReediey PD Policy Manual \nUse of Force \n  \nthe seriousness of the suspected offense or the reasonably perceived level of actual or threatened \nresistance (Government Code § 7286(b)). \nlt is also recognized that circumstances may arise in which officers reasonably believe that \nit \nwould be impractical or ineffective to use any of the approved or authorized tools, weapons, or \nmethods provided by the Agency. Officers may find \nit more effective or reasonable to improvise \ntheir response to rapidly unfolding conditions that they are confronting. In such circumstances, the \nuse of any improvised device or method must nonetheless be objectively reasonable and utilized \nonly to the degree that reasonably appears necessary to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement \npurpose. \nWhile the ultimate objective of every law enforcement encounter is to avoid or minimize injury, \nnothing in this policy requires an officer to retreat or be exposed to possible physical injury before \napplying reasonable force. \n300.3.1 \nUSE OF FORCE TO EFFECT AN ARREST \nAny peace officer may use objectively reasonable force to effect an arrest, to prevent escape, \nor to overcome resistance. A peace officer who makes or attempts to make an arrest need not \nretreat or desist from his/her efforts by reason of resistance or threatened resistance on the part \nof the person being arrested; nor shall an officer be deemed the aggressor or lose his/her right to \nself-defense by the use of reasonable force to effect the arrest, prevent escape, or to overcome \nresistance. Retreat does not mean tactical repositioning or other de-escalation techniques (Penal \nCode § 835a). \n300.3.2 \nFACTORS USED TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS OF FORCE \nWhen determining whether to apply force and evaluating whether an officer has used reasonable \nforce, \na number of factors should be taken into consideration, as time and circumstances permit \n(Government Code § 7286(b)). These factors include but are not limited to: \n(a) \nThe apparent immediacy and severity of the threat to officers or others (Penal Code \n§ 835a). \n(b) \nThe conduct of the individual being confronted, as reasonably perceived by the officer \nat the time (Penal Code § 835a). \n(c) \nOfficer/subject factors (age, size, relative strength, skill level, injuries sustained, level \nof exhaustion or fatigue, the number of officers available vs. subjects). \n(d) \nThe conduct of the involved officer leading up to the use of force (Penal Code $ 835a). \n(e) \nThe effects of suspected drugs or alcohol. \n(f) \nThe individual's apparent mental state or capacity (Penal Code $ 835a). \n(g) \nThe individual's apparent ability to understand and comply with officer commands \n(Penal Code $ 835a). \n(h) \nProximity of weapons or dangerous improvised devices. \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 3 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nUse of Force \n  \n(i) \n| The degree to which the subject has been effectively restrained and his/her ability to \nresist despite being restrained. \n(j) \nThe \navailability \nof \nother \nreasonable \nand \nfeasible \noptions \nand \ntheir \npossible \neffectiveness (Penal Code $ 835a). \n(k) \nSeriousness of the suspected offense or reason for contact with the individual prior \nto and at the time force is used. \n(l) \nTraining and experience of the officer. \n(m) \nPotential for injury to officers, suspects, bystanders, and others, \n(n) \nWhether the person appears to be resisting, attempting to evade arrest by flight, or \nis attacking the officer. \n(o) \nThe risk and reasonably foreseeable consequences of escape. \n(p) \nThe apparent need for immediate control of the subject or a prompt resolution of the \nsituation. \n(q) \nWhether the conduct of the individual being confronted no longer reasonably appears \nto pose an imminent threat to the officer or others. \n(r) \nPrior contacts with the subject or awareness of any propensity for violence. \n(s) \nAny other exigent circumstances. \n300.3.3 \nPAIN COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES \nPain compliance techniques may be effective \nin controlling \na physically or actively resisting \nindividual. Officers may only apply those pain compliance techniques \nfor which they have \nsuccessfully completed department-approved training. Officers utilizing any pain compliance \ntechnique should consider: \n(a) \nThe degree to which the application of the technique may be controlled given the level \nof resistance. \n(b) \nWhether the person can comply with the direction or orders of the officer. \n(c) \nWhether the person has been given sufficient opportunity to comply. \nThe application \nof any \npain compliance technique \nshall \nbe discontinued once \nthe \nofficer \ndetermines that compliance has been achieved. \n300.3.4 \nRESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF CAROTID CONTROL HOLD \nOfficers of this department are not authorized to use a carotid restraint hold. A carotid restraint \nmeans a vascular neck restraint or any similar restraint, hold, or other defensive tactic in which \npressure is applied to the sides of a person’s neck that involves a substantial risk of restricting \nblood flow and may render the person unconscious in order to subdue or control the person \n(Government Code § 7286.5). \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 4 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nUse of Force \n  \n300.3.5 \nUSE OF FORCE TO SEIZE EVIDENCE \nIn general, officers may use reasonable force to lawfully seize evidence and to prevent the \ndestruction of evidence. However, officers are discouraged from using force solely to prevent \na person from swallowing evidence or contraband. In the instance when force is used, officers \nshould not intentionally use any technique that restricts blood flow to the head, restricts respiration \nor which creates a reasonable likelihood that blood flow to the head or respiration would be \nrestricted. Officers are encouraged to use techniques and methods taught by the Reedley Police \nDepartment for this specific purpose. \n300.3.6 \nALTERNATIVE TACTICS - DE-ESCALATION \nAs time and circumstances reasonably permit, and when community and officer safety would \nnot be compromised, officers should consider actions that may increase officer safety and may \ndecrease the need for using force: \n(a) \nSummoning additional resources that are able to respond \nin \na reasonably timely \nmanner. \n(b) \nFormulating a plan with responding officers before entering an unstable situation that \ndoes not reasonably appear to require immediate intervention. \n(c) \nEmploying other tactics that do not unreasonably increase officer jeopardy. \nIn addition, when reasonable, officers should evaluate the totality of circumstances presented at \nthe time in each situation and, when feasible, consider and utilize reasonably available alternative \ntactics and techniques that may persuade an individual to voluntarily comply or may mitigate the \nneed to use a higher level of force to resolve the situation before applying force (Government \nCode § 7286(b)). Such alternatives may include but are not limited to: \n(a) \nAttempts to de-escalate a situation. \n(b) \nIf reasonably available, the use of crisis intervention techniques by properly trained \npersonnel. \n300.3.7 \nRESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF A CHOKE HOLD \nOfficers of this department are not authorized to use a choke hold. A choke hold means any \ndefensive tactic or force option in which direct pressure is applied to a person’s trachea or windpipe \n(Government Code § 7286.5). \n300.3.8 \nADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS \nTerms such as \"positional asphyxia,\" \"restraint asphyxia,\" and \"excited delirium\" continue to \nremain the subject of debate among experts and medical professionals, are not universally \nrecognized medical conditions, and frequently involve other collateral or controlling factors such \nas narcotics or alcohol influence or pre-existing medical conditions. While it is impractical to restrict \nan officer's use of reasonable control methods when attempting to restrain a combative individual, \nofficers are not authorized to use any restraint or transportation method which might unreasonably \nimpair an individual's breathing or respiratory capacity for \na period beyond the point when the \nindividual has been adequately and safely controlled. Once the individual is safely secured, officers \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 5 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReediey PD Policy Manual \nUse of Force \n  \nshould promptly check and continuously monitor the individual's condition for signs of medical \ndistress (Government Code § 7286.5). \n300.4 \nDEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS \nWhere feasible, the officer shall, prior to the use of deadly force, make reasonable efforts to identify \nthemself as a peace officer and to warn that deadly force may be used, unless the officer has \nobjectively reasonable grounds to believe the person is aware of those facts (Penal Code § 835a). \nIf an objectively reasonable officer would consider it safe and feasible to do so under the totality \nof the circumstances, officers shall evaluate and use other reasonably available resources and \ntechniques when determining whether to use deadly force. To the extent that \nit is reasonably \npractical, officers should consider their surroundings and any potential risks to bystanders prior to \ndischarging a firearm (Government Code § 7286(b)). \nThe use of deadly force is only justified when the officer reasonably believes it is necessary in the \nfollowing circumstances (Penal Code § 835a): \n(a) \nAn officer may use deadly force to protect themself or others from what the officer \nreasonably believes is an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer \nor another person. \n(b) \nAn officer may use deadly force to apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that \nthreatened or resulted \nin death or serious bodily injury, \nif the officer reasonably \nbelieves that the person will cause death or serious bodily injury to another unless \nimmediately apprehended. \nOfficers shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger that person poses to \nthemself, if an objectively reasonable officer would believe the person does not pose an imminent \nthreat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or to another person (Penal Code § 835a). \nAdditionally, an officer should not use deadly force against a person whose actions are a threat \nsolely to property. \nAn \"imminent\" threat of death or serious bodily injury exists when, based on the totality of the \ncircumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the \npresent ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury \nto the officer or another person. An officer's subjective fear of future harm alone is insufficient as \nan imminent threat. An imminent threat is one that from appearances is reasonably believed to \nrequire instant attention (Penal Code § 835a). \n300.4.1 \nSHOOTING AT OR FROM MOVING VEHICLES \nShots fired at or from a moving vehicle are rarely effective and involve considerations and risks \nin addition to the justification for the use of deadly force. When feasible, officers should take \nreasonable steps to move out of the path of an approaching vehicle instead of discharging their \nfirearm at the vehicle or any of its occupants. An officer should only discharge a firearm at \na moving \nvehicle or its occupants when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 6 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department \nON \nessen \nnes\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nUse of Force \n  \navailable to avert the imminent threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is \ndirected at the officer or others (Government Code § 7286(b)). \nOfficers should not shoot at any part of a vehicle in an attempt to disable the vehicle. \n300.4.2 \nDISPLAYING OF FIREARMS \nGiven that individuals might perceive the display of a firearm as a potential application of force, \nofficers should carefully evaluate each tactical situation and use sound discretion when drawing \na firearm in public by considering the following guidelines (Government Code § 7286(b)): \n(a) \nIf the officer does not initially perceive \na threat but reasonably believes that the \npotential for such threat exists, firearms should generally be kept in the low-ready or \nother position not directed toward an individual. \n(b) \nIf the \nofficer reasonably believes \nthat \na threat exists \nbased \non \nthe \ntotality \nof \ncircumstances presented \nat the time \n(e.g., \nhigh-risk stop, \ntactical \nentry, armed \nencounter), firearms may be directed toward such threat until the officer no longer \nperceives such threat. \nOnce it is reasonably safe to do so, officers should carefully secure all firearms. \n300.5 \nREPORTING THE USE OF FORCE \nAny use of force by \na member of this department shall be documented promptly, completely, \nand accurately in an appropriate report, depending on the nature of the incident. The officer \nshould articulate the factors perceived and why he/she believed the use of force was reasonable \nunder the circumstances. To collect data for purposes of training, resource allocation, analysis, \nand related purposes, the Agency may require the completion of additional report forms, as \nspecified in department policy, procedure, or law. See the Report Preparation Policy for additional \ncircumstances that may require documentation. \n300.5.1 \nNOTIFICATION TO SUPERVISORS \nAny use of force by an officer shall be reported immediately to a supervisor, including but not \nlimited to the following circumstances (Penal Code § 832.13): \n(a) \nThe application caused a visible injury. \n(b) \nThe application would lead a reasonable officer to conclude that the individual may \nhave experienced more than momentary discomfort. \n(c) \nThe individual subjected to the force complained of injury or continuing pain. \n(d) \nThe individual indicates intent to pursue litigation. \n(e) \nAny application of \na conducted energy device or control device. \n(f) \n| Any application of a restraint device other than handcuffs, shackles, or belly chains. \n(g) \nThe individual subjected to the force was rendered unconscious. \n(h) \nAn individual was struck or kicked. \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 7 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department \nO AT\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nUse of Force \n  \n(i) \nAn individual alleges unreasonable force was used or that any of the above has \noccurred. \nAs used in this subsection, \"immediately\" means as soon as it is safe and feasible to do so. \n300.5.2 \nREPORTING TO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \nStatistical data regarding \nall officer-involved shootings and incidents involving use \nof force \nresulting in serious bodily injury is to be reported to the California Department of Justice as required \nby Government Code § 12525.2. See the Records Center Policy. \n300.5.3 \nREPORT RESTRICTIONS \nOfficers shall not use the term \"excited delirium\" to describe an individual in an incident report. \nOfficers may describe the characteristics of an individual's conduct, \nbut shall not generally \ndescribe the individual's demeanor, conduct, or physical and mental condition at issue as \"excited \ndelirium\" (Health and Safety Code § 24402). \n300.6 \nMEDICAL CONSIDERATIONS \nOnce \nit is reasonably safe to do so, properly trained officers should promptly provide or procure \nmedical assistance for any person injured or claiming to have been injured in a use of force incident \n(Government Code § 7286(b)). \nPrior to booking or release, medical assistance shall be obtained for any person who exhibits signs \nof physical distress, who has sustained visible injury, expresses a complaint of injury or continuing \npain, or who was rendered unconscious. Any individual exhibiting signs of physical distress after \nan encounter should be continuously monitored until the individual can be medically assessed. \nBased upon the officer's initial assessment of the nature and extent of the subject's injuries, \nmedical assistance may consist of examination by fire personnel, paramedics, hospital staff, or \nmedical staff at the jail. \nIf any such individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal shall be \nfully documented in related reports and, whenever practicable, should be witnessed by another \nofficer and/or medical personnel. \nIf a recording is made of the contact or an interview with the \nindividual, any refusal should be included in the recording, if possible. \nThe on-scene supervisor or, if the on-scene supervisor is not available, the primary handling officer \nshall ensure that any person providing medical care or receiving custody of a person following any \nuse of force is informed that the person was subjected to force. This notification shall include a \ndescription of the force used and any other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would \nbe potential safety or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, \nimpaired respiration). \nPersons who exhibit extreme \nagitation, violent irrational behavior accompanied \nby profuse \nsweating, extraordinary strength beyond their physical characteristics and imperviousness to pain, \nor who require a protracted physical encounter with multiple officers to be brought under control, \nmay be at an increased risk of sudden death. Calls involving these persons should be considered \nmedical emergencies. Officers who reasonably suspect a medical emergency should request \nmedical assistance as soon as practicable and have medical personnel stage away if appropriate. \n  \nCopyright Lexipo!, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 8 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nUse of Force \n  \nSee the Medical Aid and Response Policy for additional guidelines. \n300.7 \nSUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY \nA supervisor should \nrespond \nto \nany \nreported \nuse \nof force, \nif reasonably \navailable. \nThe \nresponding supervisor is expected to (Government Code § 7286(b)): \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(h) \nObtain the basic facts from the involved officers. Absent an allegation of misconduct \nor excessive force, this will be considered a routine contact in the normal course of \nduties. \nEnsure that any injured parties are examined and treated. \nWhen possible, separately obtain a recorded interview with the subject upon whom \nforce was applied. If this interview is conducted without the person having voluntarily \nwaived his/her Miranda rights, the following shall apply: \n1. \nThe content of the interview should not be summarized or included in any related \ncriminal charges. \n2. \nThe fact that a recorded interview was conducted should be documented in a \nproperty or other report. \n3. \nThe recording of the interview should be distinctly marked for retention until all \npotential for civil litigation has expired. \nOnce any \ninitial medical assessment has been completed or first aid has been \nrendered, ensure that photographs have been taken of any areas involving visible \ninjury or complaint of pain, as well as overall photographs of uninjured areas. These \nphotographs should be retained until all potential for civil litigation has expired. \nIdentify any witnesses not already included in related reports. \nReview and approve all related reports. \nDetermine if there is any indication that the subject may pursue civil litigation. \n1. \n Ifthere is an indication of potential civil litigation, the supervisor should complete \nand route a notification of a potential claim through the appropriate channels. \nEvaluate the circumstances surrounding the incident and initiate an administrative \ninvestigation if there is a question of policy non-compliance or if for any reason further \ninvestigation may be appropriate. \nIn the event that a supervisor is unable to respond to the scene of an incident involving the reported \napplication of force, the supervisor is still expected to complete as many of the above items as \ncircumstances permit. \n300.7.1 \nWATCH COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITY \nThe Watch Commander shall review each use of force by any personnel within his/her command \nto ensure compliance with this policy. \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 9 \nPublished with permission by Reediey Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nUse of Force \n  \n300.8 \nTRAINING \nOfficers, investigators, and supervisors will receive annual training on this policy and demonstrate \ntheir knowledge and understanding (Government Code § 7286(b)). \n300.8.1 \nTRAINING REQUIREMENTS \nRequired annual training shall include: \n(a) \nLegal updates. \n(b) \nDe-escalation tactics, including alternatives to force. \n(c) \nThe duty to intercede. \n(d) \nThe duty to request and/or render medical aid. \n(e) \nWarning shots (see the Firearms Policy). \n(f) \nAll other subjects covered in this policy (e.g., use of deadly force, chokeholds and \ncarotid holds, discharge of a firearm at or from a moving vehicle, verbal warnings). \n(g) \nTraining courses required by and consistent with POST guidelines set forth in Penal \nCode $ 13519.10. \nSee the Training Policy for restrictions relating to officers who are the subject of a sustained use \nof force complaint. \n300.8.2 \nSTATE-SPECIFIC TRAINING REQUIREMENTS \nRequired \nstate-specific \ntraining \nshall \ninclude \nguidelines \nregarding \nvulnerable \npopulations, \nincluding but not limited to children, elderly persons, pregnant individuals, and individuals with \nphysical, mental, and developmental disabilities (Government Code $ 7286(b)). \n300.9 \nUSE OF FORCE ANALYSIS \nAt least annually, the Operations Division Commander should prepare an analysis report on use \nof force incidents. The report should be submitted to the Chief of Police. The report should not \ncontain the names of officers, suspects or case numbers, and should include: \n(a) \nThe identification of any trends in the use of force by members. \n(b) \nTraining needs recommendations. \n(c) \nEquipment needs recommendations. \n(d) \nPolicy revision recommendations. \n300.10 \nUSE OF FORCE COMPLAINTS \nThe recejpt, processing, and investigation of civilian complaints involving use of force incidents \nshould be handled in accordance with the Personnel Complaints Policy (Government Code 8 \n7286(b)). \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 10 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nUse of Force \n  \n300.11 \nPOLICY REVIEW \nThe Chief of Police or the authorized designee should regularly review and update this policy to \nreflect developing practices and procedures (Government Code § 7286(b)). \n300.12 \nPOLICY AVAILABILITY \nThe Chief of Police or the authorized designee should ensure this policy is accessible to the public \n(Government Code § 7286(c)). \n300.13 \nPUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS \nRequests for public records involving an officer's personnel records shall \nbe processed \nin \naccordance with Penal Code § 832.7 and the Personnel Records and Records Maintenance and \nRelease policies (Government Code § 7286(b)). \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nUse of Force - 11 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \n  \n  \nConducted Energy Device \n309.1 \nPURPOSE AND SCOPE \nThis policy provides guidelines for the issuance and use of the conducted energy device (CED). \n309.2 \nPOLICY \nThe CED is used in an attempt to control a violent or potentially violent individual. The appropriate \nuse of such a device may result in fewer serious injuries to officers and suspects. \n309.3 \nISSUANCE AND CARRYING CEDS \nOnly members who have successfully completed department-approved training may be issued \nand may carry the CED. \nThe Rangemaster should keep a log of issued CED devices and the serial numbers of cartridges/ \nmagazines issued to members. \nCEDs are issued for use during a member's current assignment. Those leaving a particular \nassignment may be required to return the device to the department inventory. \nOfficers shall only use the CED and cartridges/magazines that have been issued by the Agency. \nCartridges/magazines should not be used after the manufacturer's expiration date. \nUniformed officers who have been issued the CED shall wear the device in an approved holster. \nOfficers who carry the CED while in uniform shall carry it in a holster on the side opposite the duty \nweapon (Penal Code § 13660). \n(a) \nAll CEDs shall be clearly distinguishable to differentiate them from the duty weapon \nand any other device. \n(b) \nFor single-shot devices, whenever practicable, officers should carry an additional \ncartridge on their person when carrying the CED. \n(c) \nOfficers should not hold a firearm and the CED at the same time. \nNon-uniformed officers may secure the CED \nin \na concealed, secure location \nin the driver's \ncompartment of their vehicles. \n309.3.1 \nUSER RESPONSIBILITIES \nOfficers shall be responsible for ensuring that the issued CED \nis properly maintained and \nin \ngood working order. This includes a function test and battery life monitoring, as required by the \nmanufacturer, and should be completed prior to the beginning of the officer's shift. \nCEDs that are damaged or inoperative, or cartridges/magazines that are expired or damaged, \nshall be returned to the Rangemaster for disposition. Officers shall submit documentation stating \nthe reason for the return and how the CED or cartridge/magazine was damaged or became \ninoperative, if known. \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nConducted Energy Device - 1 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nConducted Energy Device \n  \n309.4 VERBAL AND VISUAL WARNINGS \nA verbal warning of the intended use of the CED should precede its application, unless \nit would \notherwise endanger the safety of officers or when \nit is not practicable due to the circumstances. \nThe purpose of the warning is to: \n(a) \nProvide the individual with a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply. \n(b) \nProvide other officers and individuals with a warning that the CED may be deployed. \nIf, after a verbal warning, an individual fails to voluntarily comply with an officer's lawful orders \nand \nit appears both reasonable and feasible under the circumstances, the officer may, but is not \nrequired to, activate any warning on the device, which may include display of the electrical arc, \nan audible warning, or the laser in a further attempt to gain compliance prior to the application of \nthe CED. The laser should not be intentionally directed into anyone's eyes. \nThe fact that a verbal or other warning was given or the reasons \nit was not given shall be \ndocumented by the officer deploying the CED in the related report. \n309.5 \nUSE OF THE CED \nThe CED has limitations and restrictions requiring consideration before its use. The CED should \nonly be used when its operator can safely deploy the device within its operational range. Although \nthe CED may be effective in controlling most individuals, officers should be aware that the device \nmay not achieve the intended results and be prepared with other options. \nIf sufficient personnel are available and can be safely assigned, an officer designated as lethal \ncover for any officer deploying \na CED may be considered for officer safety. \n309.5.1 \nAPPLICATION OF THE CED \nThe CED may be used, when the circumstances reasonably perceived by the officer at the time \nindicate that such application reasonably appears necessary to control a person who: \n(a) \nIs violent or is physically resisting. \n(b) \nHas demonstrated, by words or action, an intention to be violent or to physically resist, \nand reasonably appears to present the potential to harm officers, themself, or others. \nMere flight from a pursuing officer, without additional circumstances or factors, is not good cause \nfor the use of the CED to apprehend an individual. \nThe CED shall not be used to psychologically torment, to elicit statements, or to punish any \nindividual. \n309.5.2 \nSPECIAL DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS \nThe use of the CED on certain individuals should generally be avoided unless the totality of \nthe circumstances indicates that other available options reasonably appear ineffective or would \npresent a greater danger to the officer, the subject or others, and the officer reasonably believes \nthat the need to control the individual outweighs the potential risk of using the device. This includes: \n(a) \nIndividuals who are known to be pregnant. \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nConducted Energy Device - 2 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nConducted Energy Device \n  \n(b) \nElderly individuals or obvious juveniles. \n(c) \nIndividuals with obviously low body mass. \n(d) \nIndividuals who are handcuffed or otherwise restrained. \n(e) \nIndividuals known to have been recently sprayed with a flammable chemical agent or \nwho are otherwise known to be in close proximity to any known combustible vapor or \nflammable material, including alcohol-based oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray. \n(f) \nIndividuals whose position or activity is likely to result in collateral injury (e.g., falls \nfrom height, located in water, operating vehicles). \nAny CED capable of being applied \nin the drive-stun mode (i.e., direct contact without probes \nas a primary form of pain compliance) should be limited to supplementing the probe-mode to \ncomplete the circuit, or as a distraction technique to gain separation between officers and the \nsubject, thereby giving officers time and distance to consider other force options or actions. \n309.5.3 \nTARGETING CONSIDERATIONS \nRecognizing that the dynamics of a situation and movement of the subject may affect target \nplacement of probes, when practicable, officers should attempt to target the back, lower center \nmass, and upper legs of the subject, and avoid intentionally targeting the head, neck, area of the \nheart, or genitals. \nIf circumstances result in one or more probes inadvertently striking an area \noutside of the preferred target zones, the individual should be closely monitored until examined \nby paramedics or other medical personnel. \n309.5.4 \nMULTIPLE APPLICATIONS OF THE CED \nOnce an officer has successfully deployed two probes on the subject, the officer should continually \nassess the subject to determine \nif additional probe deployments or cycles reasonably appear \nnecessary. Additional factors officers may consider include but are not limited to: \n(a) \nWhether it is reasonable to believe that the need to control the individual outweighs \nthe potentially increased risk posed by multiple applications. \n(b) \nWhether the probes are making proper contact. \n(c) \nWhether the individual has the ability and has been given a reasonable opportunity \nto comply. \n(d) \nWhether verbal commands or other options or tactics may be more effective. \nGiven that on certain devices (e.g., TASER 10™) each trigger pull deploys a single probe, the \nofficer must pull the trigger twice to deploy two probes to create the possibility of neuro-muscular \nincapacitation. \n309.5.5 \nACTIONS FOLLOWING DEPLOYMENTS \n_Officers should take appropriate actions \nto control and restrain the individual as soon \nas \nreasonably practicable to minimize the need for longer or multiple exposures to the CED. As \nsoon as practicable, officers shall notify a supervisor any time the CED has been discharged. \nIf \nneeded for evidentiary purposes, the expended cartridge, along with any probes and wire, should \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nConducted Energy Device -3 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nConducted Energy Device \n  \nbe submitted into evidence (including confetti tags, when equipped on the device). The evidence \npackaging should be marked \"Biohazard\" if the probes penetrated the subject's skin. \n309.5.6 \nDANGEROUS ANIMALS \nThe CED may be deployed against an animal \nif the animal reasonably appears to pose an \nimminent threat to human safety. \n309.5.7 \nOFF-DUTY CONSIDERATIONS \nOfficers are not authorized to carry department CEDs while off-duty. \nOfficers shall ensure that CEDs are secured while in their homes, vehicles, or any other area \nunder their control, in \na manner that will keep the device inaccessible to others. \n309.6 \nDOCUMENTATION \nOfficers shall document all CED discharges in the related arrest/crime reports and the CED report \nforms. Photographs should be taken of any obvious probe impact or drive-stun application sites \nand attached to the CED report form. Notification shall also be made to a supervisor in compliance \nwith the Use of Force Policy. Unintentional discharges, pointing the device at a person, audible \nwarning, laser activation, and arcing the device, other than for testing purposes, will also be \ndocumented on the report form. Data downloads from the CED after use on a subject should be \ndone as soon as practicable using a department-approved process to preserve the data. \n309.6.1 \nCED REPORT FORM \nAs applicable based on the device type, items that shall be included in the CED report form are: \n(a) \nThe brand, model, and serial number of the CED and any cartridge/magazine. \n(b) \nDate, time, and location of the incident. \n(c) \nWhether any warning, display, laser, or arc deterred a subject and gained compliance. \n(d) \nThe number of probes deployed, CED activations, the duration of each cycle, the \nduration between activations, and (as best as can be determined) the duration that \nthe subject received applications. \n(e) \nThe range at which the CED was used. \n(f) \nThe type of mode used (e.g., probe deployment, drive-stun). \n(g) \nLocation of any probe impact. \n(h) \nLocation of contact in drive-stun mode. \n(i) \n| Description of where missed probes went. \n(j) \nWhether medical care was provided to the subject. \n(k) \nWhether the subject sustained any injuries. \n(l) \n| Whether any officers sustained any injuries. \nThe Training Sergeant should periodically analyze the report forms to identify trends, including \ndeterrence and effectiveness. The Training Sergeant should \nalso conduct audits \nof CED \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nConducted Energy Device - 4 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nConducted Energy Device \n  \ndevice \ndata \ndownloaded \nto \nan \napproved \nlocation \nand \nreconcile CED \nreport forms \nwith \nrecorded activations. CED information and statistics, with identifying information removed, should \nperiodically be made available to the public. \n309.6.2 \nREPORTS \nThe officer should include the following in the arrest/crime report: \n(a) \nIdentification of all personnel firing CEDs \n(b) \nIdentification of all witnesses \n(c) \nMedical care provided to the subject \n(d) \nObservations of the subject's physical and physiological actions \n(e) \nAny known or suspected drug use, intoxication, or other medical problems \n309.7 \nMEDICAL TREATMENT \nConsistent with local medical personnel protocols and absent extenuating circumstances, only \nappropriate medical personnel or officers trained in probe removal and handling should remove \nCED probes from a person's body. Used CED probes shall be treated as a sharps biohazard, \nsimilar to a used hypodermic needle, and handled appropriately. Universal precautions should \nbe taken. \nAll persons who have been struck by CED probes or who have been subjected to the electric \ndischarge of the device, or who sustained direct exposure of the laser to the eyes shall be medically \nassessed prior to booking. Additionally, any such individual who falls under any of the following \ncategories should, as soon as practicable, be examined by paramedics or other qualified medical \npersonnel: \n(a) \nThe person is suspected of being under the influence of controlled substances and/ \nor alcohol. \n(b) \nThe person may be pregnant. \n(c) \nThe person reasonably appears to be in need of medical attention. \n(d) \nThe CED probes are lodged in a sensitive area (e.g., groin, female breast, head, face, \nneck). \n(e) \nThe person requests medical treatment. \nAny individual exhibiting signs of distress or who is exposed to multiple or prolonged applications \nshall be transported to a medical facility for examination or medically evaluated prior to booking. If \nany individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal should be witnessed by another officer and/ \nor medical personnel and shall be fully documented in related reports. If an audio/video recording \nis made of the contact or an interview with the individual, any refusal should be included, if possible. \nThe transporting officer shall inform any person providing medical care or receiving custody that \nthe individual has been subjected to the application of the CED (see the Medical Aid and Response \nPolicy). \n  \nCopyright Lexipol, LLC 2024/02/07, All Rights Reserved. \nConducted Energy Device - 5 \nPublished with permission by Reedley Police Department \nPor\nReedley Police Department \nReedley PD Policy Manual \nConducted Energy Device \n  \n309.8 \nSUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES \nWhen possible, supervisors should respond to calls when they reasonably believe there \nis a \nlikelihood the CED may be used. A supervisor should respond to all incidents where the CED \nwas activated. \nA supervisor should review each incident where a person has been exposed to \na CED. The \ndevice's internal logs should be downloaded by a supervisor or Rangemaster and saved with the \nrelated arrest/crime report. The supervisor should arrange for photographs of probe sites to be \ntaken and witnesses to be interviewed. \n309.9 \nTRAINING \nPersonnel who are authorized to carry the CED shall be permitted to do so only after successfully \ncompleting the initial department-approved training. Any personnel who have not carried the CED \nas a part of their assignments for a period of six months or more shall be recertified by a qualified \nCED instructor prior to again carrying or using the device. \nProficiency training for personnel who have been issued CEDs should occur every year.

Due to his size and agitated state I felt I would need at least another deputy to reason \nand escort Anderson to court holding in order to avoid any potential issues. \n \nAt approximately 0400 hours Deputies Sosa #3509, Castillo #4897, and Rondero-Rojo #4336, and I entered House 1B \nModule to speak to Anderson about his court refusal. To see if Anderson would react differently to another Deputy I stepped \nto the side and let Deputy Sosa speak to Anderson. Deputy Sosa let Anderson know it was time to go to court. Anderson \ncomplied with Deputy Sosa's instruction but was groaning and mumbling incoherent words. The muscles in his face were \ntense and his face was red. Anderson put on his jail issued blues and stated, \"I don't know why you guys are fucking making \nme do this, I don't want to go to fucking court.\" Deputy Sosa explained to him it is a part of jail operations and we are doing \nour job. Deputy Sosa convinced him to leave the quad. Anderson walked out of the module on his own with his cane. We \nescorted Anderson outside of the module. Once we arrived at the House Corridor he stopped walking, turned around and \nfaced me and said, \"I don't have to go to fucking court.\" I told him to face away and keep walking or else I would place him in \nhandcuffs for not obeying my instructions. Anderson complied. He turned around and walked down towards GBDF \nProcessing. During our escort to GBDF Processing, Anderson said \"You're a bitch for this.\" He continued cursing specifically \nat me and called me a bitch a couple more times.  \n \nOnce we arrived at Processing, Deputy Sosa instructed Anderson to face the wall and stop talking, while we determined \nwhich holding cell he would be secured in. Anderson ignored Deputy Sosa's instructions and turned to face me. Anderson \ntensed up his body and said, \"You ain't nothing but a bitch.\" After that he took a bladed stance, stared at me and said, \"Take \noff your badge and let's see what you're about.\" I instructed him to turn around and face the wall. Anderson then quickly raised \nhis arms with closed fists and lunged towards me with his upper body as if he was going to attack me.  \n \nIn order to prevent Anderson from assaulting me I delivered an elbow strike to his face. I saw that Anderson raised his arms \nand I felt he might try to strike me. To stop him from doing this I delivered two closed fist strikes to his face. The first strike was \nwith my left hand and the next one was with my right hand on the left side of his face. Deputies Sosa and Castillo grabbed \nAnderson by an arm on each side. I grabbed Anderson on the back of the neck and shoulder area. I applied downward \npressure to push him to the floor. I gave verbal commands to stop resisting as I felt his body tense up as I pushed him to the \nfloor. My force was successful in preventing Anderson from assaulting me or any of the other deputies present. We were able \nto force Anderson onto the floor. Once on the floor Anderson was compliant.  \n \nDeputies Mccullen #3124 Enciso #6191 Denison #3743 and Calderon #4384, who were assigned to Processing were present \nduring the incident. Deputies Mccullen and Enciso handcuffed Anderson. Anderson continued to be compliant.  \n \nAt approximately 0410 hours, Sgt. Romero #7800 arrived on scene and was informed about the incident. \n \nGBDF Health staff and a gurney was requested to processing. Once they arrived, Deputies Mccullen, Calderon, and Denison \nassisted Anderson onto the gurney. Anderson rolled himself to his side. Deputy McCullen took hold of Anderson's left arm and \nDeputy Denison took hold of Anderson's right arm and assisted him to his feet. Once Anderson was on his feet, he sat on the \ngurney. Deputy Calderon grabbed Anderson's right shoulder and helped Anderson slide higher on the gurney as he was in the \nseated position. Deputy McCullen was the safety deputy during the escort to medical. Deputies Do #0361 and Robledo \n#4453, who were assigned to GBDF Medical escorted Anderson to the GBDF Medical where he was evaluated and treated by \nGBDF Health staff. Anderson was then transported to the Alvarado Hospital via Ambulance for further evaluation and \ntreatment.    \n \nAt 0500 hours, I went to Concentra Urgent Care for evaluation and was treated for my injured right thumb.  \n \nI had no further contact with Anderson.  \n \nAt approximately 0500 hours on 10/28/2023 I uploaded the digital photographs and CCTV footage of the incident onto a \ncompact disc for evidence. I submitted all related evidence into GBDF Evidence locker #12.   \n \n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nOfficer Report \n3 \nPage 3 of 3 \nCAD Event No. E8862563 \nCase No. 23145567 \n \n \nReport No. 144724 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \nReviewed By \nSH4398 - GONZALEZ, CARLOS \n133 / GBDF - George Bailey \nDetention Facility \nSH7800 - ROMERO, GEORGE \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \nReviewed Date \n10/27/2023 10:06:00 PM \n \n12/8/2023 10:36:49 PM \nNetRMS_CASDOR.rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH2821 \nPrinted: December 22, 2023 - 11:40 AM \n \n \n \nEVIDENCE: \n \nItem: 1 \n \nDescription: Compact Disc with video footage and two (2) digital photographs \n \nFound By: CG 4398. \n \nMarked By: CG 4398 10/28/2023 \n \nDisposition: GBDF Evidence Locker #12  \n \n \nINJURIES: \n \nAnderson sustained a fractured nose and was treated at Alvarado Hospital. \n \nDeputy Gonzalez sustained a sprained right thumb.  \n \n \nWITNESSES:  \n \n None. \n \n \nRELATED REPORTS:   \n \nDeputy Sosa's Officer Report \nDeputy Castillo's Officer Report \nDeputy Rondero-Rojo Officer Report \nDeputy McCullen Officer Report \nDeputy Enciso Officer Report \nDeputy Calderon Officer Report \nDeputy Denison Officer Report \nSergeant Romero Officer Report \n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nUse of Force Supplemental \n \n \n    \n(Revised 5/17/13 NetRMS) \n \nPrinted By SH2821 \nPrinted: December 22, 2023 - 11:40 AM \n \nUFO DATE AND TIME \nEVENT NUMBER \nCASE NUMBER \nDOCUMENT NUMBER \nSTATION/FACILITY \n10/26/2023 04:00 \nE8862563 \n23145567 \n144724 \nGBDF - George Bailey Detention Facility \nINCIDENT DESCRIPTION / OFFENSES \nEscorting I/P Anderson to GBDF Processing \nSUBJECT’S NAME (LAST, FIRST, MI) \nDATE OF BIRTH \nARRESTED \nSUPERVISOR PRESENT \nDATE/TIME SUPERVISOR NOTIFIED \nAnderson, Ryan Thomas \n \n \n        Yes          No \n     Yes            No \n10/26/2023 04:10 \n \nREASON(S) FOR \nUSING FORCE: \n \nNecessary to effect            \nan arrest \n \nNecessary to defend self or \nanother \n \nNecessary to prevent \nescape/evasion \n \nNecessary to effect a lawful \ndetention \n \nNecessary to prevent a \nviolent forcible felony \n \nNecessary to restrain for \nsubject’s safety \n \nNecessary during high-risk \nincident \n \nNecessary during riot \n \n \nDelaying Jail Operations \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSUBJECT APPEARED TO BE \nNUMBER OF OFFICERS ON SCENE \nNUMBER OF OFFICERS USING FORCE \n      Under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs \n       Mentally impaired \n8 \n1 \n \nLEVEL(S) OF RESISTANCE ENCOUNTERED \n \nNONE (subject cooperated/complied) \n \nPASSIVE RESISTANCE (represents by a refusal to respond  to verbal \ncommands but also offers no form of physical resistance) \n \nPSYCHOLOGICAL INT MIDATION (non-verbal cues indicating subject’s attitude or \nphysical readiness to resist) \n \nACTIVE RESISTANCE (pushing, pulling or running away from the officer to \navoid control; not attempting to harm the officer) \n \nVERBAL NON-COMPLIANCE (subject’s expressed unwillingness to comply with the \nofficer’s commands) \n \nASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR (physical actions of assault) \n \n \nAGGRAVATED ACTIVE AGGRESSION (potential injury or death) \n \nLAW ENFORCEMENT TOOL/TECHNIQUE USED TO GAIN COMPLIANCE OR OVERCOME RESISTANCE (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY) \n \nVerbal Commands: \n\"Stop resisting\" \n \n \nEmpty Hand Control \n  Less-Lethal Weapon System \nDischarges \n \nNumber of \n \nTarget \n \n \n    Grab, Push, Pull, or Body Weight \n \n     PepperBall - OC Powder \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Control Hold \n(Duration: ) \n \n     PepperBall - Water \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Pressure Point  (Duration: ) (# of Contacts: ) \n \n     37 mm Rifle - Standard \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Strike  \n(Body part used: head) (# of Contacts: 3) \n \n     37 mm Rifle - Low Energy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Takedown  \nType: \nback \n \n \n     40 mm Rifle - Bean Bag \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Carotid  (Rendered Unconscious?

The four officers have been \nplaced on administrative leave as per department policy.  \n \nOne of the civilians in the incident who was transported to the hospital is deceased. In \naccordance with Assembly Bill 1506 (https://oag.ca.gov/ois-incidents), the Martinez \nPolice Department notified the California Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ is \nleading the investigation and will independently review the officer-involved shooting. \n \nMedia inquiries can be directed to DOJ’s press line at (916) 210-6000. \n \n----- \n \nOn August 18, 2023, around 3:27 a.m., the Martinez Police Department received a \nreport of a video alarm at Velvet, a cannabis dispensary, located at 4808 Sunrise Drive. \nWhile enroute, officers were advised of multiple subjects at the business along with two \nvehicles. \n \nOfficers arrived on scene around 3:32 a.m. and one of the vehicles, described as a \nwhite SUV, fled the scene. Officers broadcast that shots were fired and there was an \nassault on an officer. The second vehicle attempted to flee and then crashed into a fire \nhydrant. The two occupants of the vehicle were transported to the hospital.  \n \nAdditional law enforcement agencies responded to secure the scene. The Martinez \nPolice Department initiated an investigation with the Contra Costa County District \nAttorney’s Office in accordance with the countywide protocol for officer-involved \nshootings. One officer is receiving treatment at the hospital for what is believed to be a \nminor injury. \n \nThe investigating agencies have responded with extensive resources to determine \nexactly what took place. The area where the incident occurred remains closed while \ncrime scene investigators collect evidence. The officers involved were wearing body-\nworn cameras and footage is being reviewed as part of the investigation. \n \nThe investigation is in its early stages and ongoing. Further information is expected to \nbe released this evening. Additionally, our understanding of the incident may change as \nmore individuals are interviewed and evidence is collected and analyzed. \n \n \nIf you have information regarding this incident, please contact Investigations at 925-372-\n3450. \n \n \n \n \nANDREW WHITE \nChief of Police",

If you are not able to clock \nin or clock out due to being out of the office working an assignment, please bring in \nyour time card to me and we will manually fill in the time and Lt. J. Serrano or I will \ninitial the time.\" \nI obtained emails regarding direction from the Operation Stone Garden Program \nManager Bryan Kastoll (Addenda 8A-E). An email dated October 15, 2013 directed to \nSerrano and others and forwarded to Tabarez, Duran and M. Gomez contained the \nfollowing comments: \n\"1 had a recent internal audit of all Daily Activity reports done and a couple of issues came \nup. \n1. OPSG overtime is only utilized to perform activities that are on your Operation \nPlan. If your Op plan states your agency will patrol certain areas and do specific \nthings, then that is what you are supposed to do. There were several DARs \nsubmitted that stated officers/agents/deputies were in a certain area performing \nduties because of a lack of regular manpower. This is supplanting and is not \nallowable. If you [stet] Department is short manpower, OPSG overtime will not be \nused to fill that gap. OPSG overtime is not an administrative filler. If an \noffer/agent/deputy is working OPSG overtime, they will not make hospital runs, \nfinish pending paperwork, make jail runs for others, or do any activity not \nmentioned in the Ops order. If this practice of using OPSG OT to fill your daily \n- 8 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nassignments does not stop, we will be in some serious trouble with FEMA and may \nlose funding all together. \n2. The DARs need to be completed thoroughly. The narrative portion needs to be \nclear and concise as to the location worked and what activities were performed \nduring the shift. I am still getting DARs with nothing in the narrative portion or \nany corresponding paperwork detailing the shift activities.\" \nThe email dated July 10, 2014 contained the following direction (Addendum 8B): \n\"Grant Management: In all ofyour applications it was written that the individual \ndepartment would supervise and monitor their officers to ensure compliance with the \nOPSG grant while working OT under OPSG. It is imperative that the work being conducted \nwhile on OT is in line with the grant guidelines. You know your people better than I do \nbut, if I can read a DAR and determine the officer is a slug, then you should know this as \nwell and not assign this officer to work OT. I understand that not every day will be full of \narrests and citations but, when the same officer submits several OT slips where nothing \nwas done, I have to wonder what this officer was doing for the hours claimed as OT.\" \nRegarding Daily Activity Reports (DAR), the email contained the following directions: \n\"DARs: The DARs are a vital part of the tracking process for this grant. Ensure that your \nofficers are filling out the DAR completely and accurately. This includes the date, time, \nhours worked, rate of OT pay, total for OT shift, miles driven and the number of stops, \ncitations, arrests, seizures and all relevant information from the shift. The narrative \nportion needs to reflect what the officer did during the OT shift. You as the POC for the \nOPSG grant or a designee need to ensure this is done for all DARs before it is submitted to \nme. All incomplete DARs will be sent back [to] the sender for corrections.\" \nI also obtained Stone Garden Overtime sign-up sheets which include the mission for the \ntime period and mission specific Stone Garden details and associated sign-up sheets \n(Addenda 10A-MMMM). An exemplar Stone Garden Detail sign-up sheet for April 2014 \n(Addenda 10KKK-NNN) contained the following instructions. \n\"From April 1, 2014 to April 30, 2014 the Calexico Police Department will be conducting \nstreet enforcement on the business district of Calexico by the International Border. This \nwill provide a safe environment for the businesses near the border. Two police officers will \nbe assigned to work this detail on two 8 hour shifts and they are from 0700-1500 hours \nand 1400-2200 hours. \nIt will be the mission of the Calexico Police Department to enforce all local, state and \nfederal laws in order to prevent all forms of thefts, assaults, accidents, reckless driving and \npersons entering the country illegally. It will also be the mission of the Calexico Police \nDepartment to search for illegal drugs, currency and contraband that are found inside a \n- 9 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Lim CAs1LLAs \nCONFIDENTIAL \nvehicle.

If the signed officer is later aware that \nhe/she is unable to work this, that officer will be responsible for getting a replacement. If \nyou have any questions contact Sergeant Victor Legaspi or Lieutenant Jesus Serrano.\" \nI requested and obtained from the Calexico Police Department, all Stone Garden \nOvertime and Daily Activity Reports from August 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014. I \nthoroughly reviewed and analyzed the reports (Addenda 12-17). I noted that Casillas \ndid not work any Stone Garden Overtime in August, September or October 2013 and \nFebruary and March 2014. \nI compared Casillas' DARs to the provided Operations Plans (Addenda 10A-MMMM) to \ndetermine if Casillas' activities and his shifts were consistent with the posted details \nand mission. Where information was available, the results of the analysis are included \nin the specific dates analysis provided further below in the report. \nI requested and obtained time cards for Casillas from September 1, 2013 through June \n30, 2014 (Addenda 18A-YYY). I thoroughly reviewed and analyzed the time cards. \nI requested and obtained a Spillman run by responsible officer for Luis Casillas from \nNovember 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014 (Addenda 21A-G). Spillman is the Computer \nAided Dispatch (CAD)/Records Management System (RMS) that the Calexico Police \nDepartment uses for managing calls, activity, incidents and reports. I thoroughly \nreviewed and analyzed the Spillman reports. I also requested and received a query of \nall citations issued by Officer Casillas from September 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014 \n(Addenda 23A-Z). \nI requested and obtained copies of the Vehicle Mileage Logs from September 1, 2013 \nthrough June 30, 2014. I thoroughly reviewed and analyzed the logs (Addenda 25A-HH \n& 26A-EEEE). I noted some dates were missing from the logs (Investigator's Note 1). I \nfurther requested additional mileage logs that I noted were missing in the log pages for \nJune 17, 2014 - June 20, 2014. I added them to the addenda as pages (b) of Addenda \n26111 and 26JJJ. I also requested mileage logs for June 1 through August 31, 2013 \n(Addenda 24 A-BB). \nTo better visualize the data specific to Casillas, I created a spreadsheet noting the \ninformation obtained (Addenda 7A-F). I highlighted in yellow those areas where there \n-10-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \n➢NVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVEI;TIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nwere inconsistencies and/or issues that required further analysis and explanation and \nwhich may indicate inappropriate conduct. \nGenerally, I noted that Casillas signed his overtime slips. Casillas regularly had his \novertime slips approved by a supervisor or acting supervisor in November and \nDecember, 2013 and January 2014. Casillas did not work any Stone Garden overtime in \nFebruary or March. In April 2014, I noticed a change in his overtime slips. In April \n2014, Casillas' overtime slips were not approved and signed by a supervisor. In May \n2014, one of two was signed by a supervisor. In June 2014, one of two overtime slips \nwas signed by a supervisor. This change coincided with his promotion/assignment to \nInvestigations on April 2, 2014. In Investigations, Casillas' supervisor was Sergeant \nGerman Duran. \nCasillas also generally did not advise Dispatch of his vehicle and beginning odometer \nreading when he went out in the field. Of 21 Stone Garden dates, Casillas advised \nDispatch of his odometer reading on only five occasions. Those times were noted on a \nspreadsheet (Addenda 7A-F) in the second to last column. \nI noticed on many occasions that Casillas' odometer readings did not appear to be \nconsistent with prior or later odometer readings for the same vehicle. It happened \nmost often with Unit 570, but he also showed inconsistent odometer readings when \ndriving Unit 582, Unit 527 and Unit 571. The inconsistent readings for the units are \nincluded in more detail further below. \nTo better investigate the inconsistencies, I reviewed the Vehicle Assignment list for \n2014 and the Vehicle Inventory list for 2006 (Addenda 31 & 32). I noted that Unit #570 \nwas a 2007 Ford Crown Victoria which is consistent with the fact that it was not on the \n2006 Vehicle Inventory List. \nI then reviewed the Mileage Logs (Addenda 24-26). I began the review for entries in \nMay 31, 2013 (Addendum 24A-BB) and noted several entries for Unit #570 over the \nfollowing months. I noted that often times the odometer was noted as unreadable, \nillegible or there was nothing in the space. I opined that the vehicle must have a faulty \ndigital odometer making it difficult to read. However, I noted that several officers \nprovided odometer readings that were noted, some very precisely to the decimal point, \nin the mileage log. I opined that the problem must be intermittent, more easily visible \nin certain light, or perhaps, those that gave odometer readings tried harder to interpret \nthe mileage. \nSince there were so many readings, I decided to make a spreadsheet noting the mileage \nfrom September 6, 2013 until June 16, 2014 (Addenda 30A-B). I noted that in \nSeptember 2013, some officers indicated that that the odometer was unreadable, \nwhereas Villapudua, Porras, and Uriarte all noted odometer readings in the 130,000 \nrange. Then, on September 30, 2013, the odometer readings dropped to 86212. I \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luis CAsiLiAs \nCONFIDENTIAL \nconsidered that either Unit #570 was used for another vehicle, the odometer had been \ntampered with either to get it to work or maliciously and the odometer read differently \nand/or employees were falsely transmitting to Dispatch the odometer readings. Since \nthe odometer was noted as unreadable many times after that date, I determined that \nthe vehicle readings in early September were from the same vehicle as the vehicle in \nlate September and thereafter. I then reviewed the odometer readings in the \nspreadsheet and noted that for the most part, there was a reasonable progression of \n86212 on September 30, 2013 to 93191.1 on June 14, 2014. June 15 and 16 were both \nunreadable and thereafter, through September 2, 2014 there were no more entries for \nUnit #570. \nThere were a few exceptions to this progression. I noted that on November 5, 2013, \nFlores noted the mileage at 68443. I did not determine the cause of the inconsistency. \nOn January 3, 2013, Garcia noted the mileage at 94022; again, I did not determine the \ncause of the inconsistency. Thereafter, I reviewed numerous but, not all Stone Garden \nDAR's and noted several where officers were driving Unit #570. I found again, for the \nmost part, a steady progression from October 1, 2013 through April 11, 2014 (Addenda \n33A-CC). \nI then noted that two officers (Frazier and Flores) showed driving the same unit (582 \nand 570) as Casillas on December 15 and December 19, 2013. I then requested time \ncards for Officer Victor Flores and Frazier for Pay Period 12/24/2013 (Addenda 19A-D \n&20A-D) and determined that Casillas noted on his DAR that he was driving the same \nvehicles as Frazier and Flores at the same time that Frazier and Flores logged in driving \nthose vehicles. \nI determined from the review of the data, that Casillas' DAR odometer readings on at \nleast six dates were inconsistent with the steady progression of the mileage for Unit \n#570. Even taking into account that Unit #570's odometer was intermittently \nunreadable, there is sufficient data to observe a progression of odometer readings in \nthe 86,000 to 90,000 range from September 30, 2013 through June 14, 2014. \nI further determined from the review of the data that Casillas' DAR odometer readings \non four occasions were inconsistent with the mileage for Unit 582. I also determined \nfrom the review of the data that Casillas' DAR odometer readings on two occasions \nwere inconsistent with the mileage for Unit 571 and one time for Unit 527. \nI also noted that on several occasions where Casillas indicated on his DAR that he wrote \ncitations, the citation query returned no citations issued by Casillas. \nI further noted: \n- 12 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nIn the November 2013 billing period report, 11 officers worked Stone Garden overtime. \nOf those, one worked five shifts, one worked four shifts, one worked three shifts, five \nworked two shifts and three worked one shift. Casillas worked three shifts. \nIn the December 2013 billing period report, 17 officers worked Stone Garden overtime. \nOf those 17, one worked 19 shifts, one worked 16 shifts, one worked 11 shifts, one \nworked 10 shifts, two worked nine shifts, one worked seven shifts, two worked five \nshifts, two worked four shifts, two worked three shifts, two worked two shifts and one \nworked one shift. Casillas worked 10 shifts, of which only nine showed up on the billing \nsummary. \nIn the January 2014 billing period report, 19 officers worked Stone Garden overtime. Of \nthe 19 officers, two worked five shifts, eight worked two shifts, and nine worked one \nshift. Casillas worked one shift. \nIn the April 2014 billing period report, 17 officers worked Stone Garden overtime. Of \nthe 17 officers, one worked ten shifts, one worked eight shifts, six worked three shifts, \ntwo worked two shifts and seven worked one shift. Casillas worked three shifts. \nIn the May 2014 billing period report, 10 officers worked Stone Garden overtime. Of \nthose 10, one worked twelve shifts, one worked ten shifts, one worked five shifts, one \nworked four shifts, two worked two shifts and four worked one shift. Casillas worked \ntwo shifts. \nIn the June billing period report, 13 officers worked Stone Garden overtime. Of those \n13 officers one worked nine shifts, one worked eight shifts, one worked five shifts, two \nworked four shifts, one worked three shifts, two worked two shifts and five worked one \nshift. Casillas worked two shifts. \nA review of the data and spreadsheet revealed that during the above noted time \nperiods, Casillas worked 21 shifts. The following patterns emerged: \nI noted that Casillas often engaged in no field activities during Stone Garden shifts. I \nnoted that during four of the 21 shifts where DARs were submitted, Casillas noted no \nactivity. I noted on the remaining dates where Casillas noted he engaged in various \nfield activities including traffic stops, field interviews and arrests, Spillman showed no \nactivity during the hours Casillas worked Stone Garden overtime on nine of 21 dates. \nOn many other occasions, Spillman showed considerably less and different activity than \nnoted by Casillas on his DAR. I noted on one occasions (December 5, 2013), Casillas \nnoted no activity on his DAR and Spillman showed he conducted four traffic stops, \nwrote three citations and had one flag down. I further noted that the activity noted on \nCasillas' December 6, 2013 was consistent with Casillas' Spillman activity for December \n5, 2013, a date which Casillas noted no activity on his DAR. \n-13-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luis CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nA review of the Casillas' narratives revealed that about 50 percent of the time his \nnarratives were different from day to day. The rest of the time, his narratives were the \nsame from two to four days. I noted that the same narrative was used for November 6 \nand 8, 2013; December 14 and 15, 2013; November 30, December 16, 19, 20 and 25, \n2013; and May 30 and June 13, 2014. \nI further noted that on several occasions, Casillas worked Stone Garden overtime shifts \nthat were not included in an operation plan. The most obvious time was during the \nmonth of May 2014 when Casillas worked two Stone Garden shifts. The only operations \nplan I was provided that included May 2014 was for Operation Mountain Top. It was \npublished on May 30, 2014 and the details ran from June 1 through September 30, 2014 \n(Addenda 10UUU-10IIII). \nI noted the following more date specific inconsistencies and issues: \nNovember 2013 (Addenda 12A-K) \nNovember 6, 2013 \nCasillas worked a four hour Stone Garden shift from 1500 to 1900 hours. November 6, \n2013 was a Wednesday. Casillas' DAR indicated he drove Unit #570, Ford Crown \nVictoria, for 20 miles. The odometer readings were 137796-137859, which is actually \n63 not 20 miles. The investigation revealed that Unit#570 has intermittent odometer \nvisibility issues and in November 2013, other employees reported mileage in the \namount of 86820 to 87177 (Addendum 30A-B). Moreover, a review of other DAR's and \ninformation from the same day revealed that Victor Flores submitted a DAR for Stone \nGarden overtime worked that day(Addendurn 20A-D) from 1500-1900 hours (the same \nshift as Casillas). His DAR showed that he was driving Unit #570 and his odometer \nreadings were 86212-86227 for a total of 15 miles. Neither Casillas nor Flores noted on \ntheir DAR's that they were working with one another. I noted that Casillas drove Unit \n#570 on November 30, 2013 and Casillas noted that his odometer readings were \n87175-87187. I further noted that Casillas' mileage on November 6 and 8 is totally \ninconsistent with prior and subsequent odometer readings and his own reading on \nNovember 30, 2013. Additionally, Casillas showed driving a vehicle that someone else \nindicated they were driving at the exact same time. The fact that Casillas' odometer \nreadings for Unit #570 were so inconsistent with the progression for that unit and the \nFlores' odometer readings were consistent indicates that it is more likely than not that \nFlores' odometer readings were the accurate ones and therefore, suggests falsification \nof the vehicle, the mileage and the odometer readings by Casillas. Also, Casillas noted \non his DAR that he wrote four citations, conducted eight field interviews and five traffic \nstops. Spillman showed only one incident for Casillas that day; one patrol check at 2:50 \na.m. which was not within his submitted Stone Garden shift. The citation query \nreturned no citations written by Casillas (Addendum 23C). Casillas' narrative was the \nsame as the November 8, 2013 narrative with the exception of the number of traffic \nstops. However, the comment \"no field interviews or arrests were conducted\" was \n-14-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luis CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nincluded in the narrative when in his activity he indicated he conducted eight field \ninterviews. I received no operations plans that included November 6, 2013. Casillas' \ntime card revealed a clock in but no clock out time. \nNovember 8, 2013 \nCasillas worked a four hour Stone Garden shift from 1500 to 1900 hours. November 8, \n2013 was a Friday. Casillas' DAR indicated he drove Unit #570, Ford Crown Victoria, \nfor 20 miles. The odometer readings were 1385943879. The time, Unit, mileage and \nnarrative were exactly the same information as was on Casillas' DAR on November 6, \n2013. The same analysis applies for this date. The investigation revealed that Unit \n#570 has intermittent odometer visibility issues and in November 2013, other \nemployees reported mileage in the amount of 86820 to 87177 (Addend 30A-B). I also \nnoted that Casillas drove Unit #570 on November 30, 2013 and Casillas noted that his \nodometer readings were 87175-87187. 1 further noted that Casillas' mileage on \nNovember 6 and 8 is totally inconsistent with prior and subsequent odometer readings \nand his own odometer reading for the same vehicle on November 30, 2013. The fact \nthat Casillas' odometer readings for Unit #570 were so inconsistent with the odometer \nprogression for that unit and that Flores' odometer readings on November 6, 2013 \nwhere he showed driving the same vehicle during the same exact hours, were \nconsistent, indicates that it is more likely than not that Flores' odometer readings were \nthe accurate ones and therefore, suggests falsification of the mileage and the odometer \nreadings by Casillas. Also, Casillas noted on his DAR that he wrote eight citations, \nconducted eight field interviews and five traffic stops. Spillman showed only one \nincident for Casillas that day; one patrol check at 2:50 a.m. which was not within his \nsubmitted Stone Garden shift. Spillman showed Casillas conducted five traffic stops and \none \"close patrol.\" Casillas' narrative was the same as the November 6, 2013 narrative \nwith the exception of the number of traffic stops. However, the number of violations \n(four) was the same on the DAR even though he noted in his activity that he wrote eight \ncitations. Moreover, the comment \"no field interviews or arrests were conducted\" was \nincluded in the narrative when in his activity he indicated he conducted eight field \ninterviews. I received no operations plans that included November 8, 2013. \nNovember 30, 2013 \nCasillas worked an eight hour Stone Garden shift from 1500 to 2300 hours. November \n30, 2013 was a Saturday. Casillas' DAR indicated he drove Unit #570, Ford Crown \nVictoria, for 15 miles. The odometer readings were 87175-87187 which actually \ncalculates to 12 miles not 15 miles. The investigation revealed that Unit #570 has \nintermittent odometer visibility issues and in November 2013, other employees \nreported mileage in the amount of 86820 to 87177 (Addenda 30A-B). I also noted that \nOfficer McEntire drove Unit #570 during a regular shift on November 28, 2013 (two \ndays prior to Casillas driving it) and the mileage start odometer reading was 87177 \n(Addendum 25GG). I further noted that McEntire's odometer reading had been \ncorrected on the log. I then noted that on December 2, 2013, Flores showed driving \nUnit #570 for a regular shift and the mileage was 87187.3 (Addendum 25HH) which is \n- 15 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nconsistent with McEntire's mileage being as corrected at 87177. Given the findings \nfrom the prior dates and the miscalculation of the mileage, it is more likely than not that \nCasillas' odometer readings are the inaccurate readings and again suggests falsification \nof the information on the DAR. Also, Casillas noted on his DAR that he conducted eight \nfield interviews and five traffic stops. Spillman showed no activity for Casillas during \nhis Stone Garden shift. Furthermore, Casillas noted in his narrative that he \"conducted \nfour interviews, no arrests were conducted\" when he noted in his activity that he \nconducted eight field interviews. Also, I noted that on November 29, 2013, Casillas \nworked overtime for Officer Salinas from 1900 to the next morning on November 30, \n2013 at 0700. Casillas then returned to work at 1500 hours to work the Stone Garden \nshift. He clocked in at 3:04 p.m. but failed to clock out. I noted that his time card \nshowed Casillas worked 20 hours in one day. Casillas actually worked 16 hours in a 24 \nhour period thus, he was not in violation of the limitation of 16 hours worked \n(Addend181-14. Casillas' narrative indicated he conducted patrol checks and also foot \npatrol at the Gran Plaza. Per the operations plans, the Gran Plaza detail was cancelled \nfor November 30, 2013 (Addendum 10Z). The highway interdiction detail had two \nofficers working per day for 10 hour shifts from 1100-2100. The holiday enforcement \ndetail also had two officers working per day for 10 hour shifts from 1100-2100. \nTherefore, Casillas worked two hours outside of any operation plan that was scheduled \nfor the date. \nDecember 2013 (Addenda 13A-BB) \nDecember 4, 2013 \nCasillas worked a three and one half hour Stone Garden shift from 1530 to 1900 hours. \nDecember 4, 2013 was a Wednesday. His DAR showed he drove Unit #580, Crown \nVictoria, with an odometer reading of 59975-59982. Casillas' shift for this date was not \nincluded in the December 2013 billing summary. Casillas logged on with Unit #580 and \na beginning mileage of 59935 which is different than the odometer reading noted on his \nDAR. Casillas noted that he conducted three vehicle stops, issued two citations and \nconducted two field interviews. Spillman showed that he conducted two traffic stops \nand one vehicle burglary call. The citation query showed that Casillas wrote two \ncitations during his Stone Garden shift at 1710 and 1745 hours respectively. Casillas' \ntime card showed that he did not clock out for his Stone Garden shift. \nDecember 5, 2013 \nCasillas' DAR showed he worked a four hour Stone Garden shift from 1300-1900 hours. \nHowever, 1300-1900 is actually six hours. A review of Casillas' overtime slip showed \nthat he worked from 1500-1900, for a four hour period. His timecard showed he \nstarted watch on December 5, 2013 at 3:29 p.m., 30 minutes later than his overtime slip \nindicated. There was no clock out time stamp. Casillas' DAR showed he drove Unit \n#571, a Crown Vic. He did not indicate any mileage or odometer readings, The mileage \nlog (Addendum 26B) showed that he logged on with a different vehicle, Unit #580 with \na log on odometer reading of 59892 which is a greater odometer mileage than the \n-16-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nending mileage for Unit #580 from December 4, 2014 where Casillas advised Dispatch \nthat he was driving Unit 580 with a mileage of 59935 (Addendum 25HH). Casillas' DAR \nshows no operational activities. However, his Spillman run showed he conducted four \ntraffic stops, wrote three citations and handled one flag down. \nDecember 6, 2013 \nCasillas' DAR indicated he worked a four hour Stone Garden shift. However, his DAR \ndid not show the hours he worked. His overtime slip showed he worked from 1505-\n1905 hours. Casillas noted he drove Unit #580, Crown Vic. He did not note the mileage \nor odometer readings. The mileage logs showed that Casillas was driving Unit 571 for \nStone Garden and his beginning mileage was 85900 (Addendum 26B). Casillas noted \nthat he conducted four vehicle stops and three citations were issued. Spillman showed \nno activity for Casillas during his Stone Garden shift. Casillas' narrative indicated he \ncited three drivers for vehicle code violations. The citation query returned no citations \nwritten by Casillas. I opined that this DAR may actually be the December 5, 2013 DAR \nand the dates on the two DAR's were incorrectly entered, December 5 actually being \nDecember 6 and December 6 actually being December 5, 2013. \nDecember 14, 2013 \nCasillas worked a six and one half hour Stone Garden shift from 1300 to 1930 hours. \nHis DAR showed he was driving Unit #582, a Ford, Crown Vic. His odometer readings \nwere 97000-97011. He drove 11 miles. I noted on the mileage log that the beginning \nodometer readings for Unit #582 in December 2013 were in the 85,000-86,000 range. \nOn December 15, 2013 Frazier shows driving 582 for a regular shift. His beginning \nmileage was 85765 (Addendum 26D). On December 28, 2013, Frazier showed driving \n582 for a regular shift with a mileage of 86134 (Addendum 26G). Other mileage log \nentries were consistent with Frazier's suggesting that Casillas falsified his DAR. Casillas \nnoted that he conducted three vehicle stops. Casillas' narrative indicated he had 16 \npedestrian contacts, the same number as on December 15, 2013. Spillman showed no \nactivity for Casillas. I noted that the narrative on Casillas' DAR was the exact same \nnarrative as December 15, 2013. I further noted that for this date, there was one time \nstamp at 9:00 a.m. but, no other time stamps for the Stone Garden shift. \nDecember 15, 2013 \nCasillas worked a 12 hour Stone Garden shift from 1200 to 0000 hours. December 14, \n2013 was a Saturday. His DAR showed he was driving Unit #582, a Ford, Crown Vic. \nHis odometer readings were 97011-97027; follow on readings from December 14, \n2013. He drove 16 miles. I noted on the mileage log that the beginning odometer \nreadings for Unit #582 in December 2013 were in the 85,000-86,000 range. On \nDecember 15, 2013 Frazier shows driving Unit #582 for an eight hour overtime shift \nstarting at 7:00 a.m. His beginning mileage was 85765 (Addendum 26D). Therefore, \nper Casillas' DAR he was driving the same vehicle Frazier was driving for three hours \nthat Frazier was driving Unit 582, Also, on December 28, 2013, Frazier showed driving \nUnit #582 for a regular shift with a mileage of 86134 (Addendum 26G). Other mileage \n-17-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nlog entries were consistent with Frazier's suggesting that Casillas falsified his DAR. \nCasillas noted that he conducted three vehicle stops. Casillas' narrative indicated he \nhad 16 pedestrian contacts, the same number as on December 14, 2013. Spillman \nshowed a patrol check at 22:53 hours. I noted that the narrative on Casillas' DAR was \nthe same narrative as December 14, 2013. Per the operations plans, the highway \ninterdiction detail had two officers working per day for 10 hour shifts from 1100-2100. \nThe holiday enforcement detail also had two officers working per day for 10 hour shifts \nfrom 1100-2100. Therefore, Casillas worked three hours in excess of the scheduled \nshifts. \nDecember 16, 2013 \nCasillas worked an 11 hour Stone Garden shift from 1300 to 0000 hours. His DAR \nshowed he was driving Unit #582, a Ford, Crown Vic. His odometer readings were \n91110-91120. These readings are 6,000 miles fewer than his previous 2 day's readings \nwhere he noted he was driving the same vehicle. He drove 10 miles. I noted on the \nmileage log that the beginning odometer reading for Unit #582 in December 2013 was \nin the 85,000-86,000 range. On December 15, 2013 Frazier shows driving Unit #582 \nfor a regular shift. His beginning mileage was 85765 (Addendum 26D). On December \n28, 2013, Frazier showed driving 582 for a regular shift with a mileage of 86134 \n(Addendum 26G). Other mileage log entries were consistent with Frazier's suggesting \nthat Casillas falsified his DAR. Casillas' DAR narrative was the same as his DAR \nnarrative for November 30, 2013. Casillas noted in his activities that he conducted \neight field interviews. In his narrative, Casillas noted that he conducted four field \ninterviews and no arrests were conducted. Spillman showed that he conducted two \npedestrian checks. Per the operations plans, the highway interdiction detail had two \nofficers working per day for 10 hour shifts from 1100-2100. The holiday enforcement \ndetail also had two officers working per day for 10 hour shifts from 1100-2100. \nTherefore, Casillas worked three hours in excess of the scheduled shifts. \nDecember 17. 2013 \nCasillas worked a four hour Stone Garden shift from 1500 to 1900 hours. His DAR \nindicated he was driving Unit #582, Ford Crown Victoria. His odometer readings were \n91120-91123. He drove three miles. His odometer readings were follow-on readings to \nhis December 16 mileage which were both 6,000 miles fewer than his December 14 and \n15, 2013 odometer readings. Moreover, Casillas logged on for a Stone Garden shift on \nDecember 17, 2013 with a different vehicle, Unit 581 and 91079 as his beginning \nodometer reading (Addendum 26E). Mileage log readings for Unit #581 in mid-\nDecember were in the 91,000 range. I further noted on the mileage log that the \nbeginning odometer reading for Unit #582 in December 2013 was in the 85,000-86,000 \nrange. On December 15, 2013, Frazier shows driving Unit #582 for a regular shift. His \nbeginning mileage was 85765 (Addendum 26D). On December 28, 2013, Frazier \nshowed driving 582 for a regular shift with a mileage of 86134 (Addendum 26G). Other \nmileage log entries were consistent with Frazier's. All of the data suggests that Casillas \nfalsified his vehicle and odometer readings on his DAR. With the exception of the last \n- 18 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nsentence, Casillas' narrative was the same narrative as his December 16, 2013. Casillas \nnoted that he issued one citation, conducted four field interviews, participated in one \nnarcotics seizure and completed one crime report. Spillman noted one traffic stop for \nCasillas. \nDecember 19, 2013 \nCasillas worked an eight hour Stone Garden shift from 1500 to 2300 hours. December \n19, 2013 was a Thursday. His DAR indicated that he worked on December 18, 2013. \nHowever, a review of his time card and overtime slips showed he actually worked on \nDecember 19, 2013. His DAR further showed that Casillas drove Unit #570, Ford Crown \nVictoria for 10 miles. His odometer readings were 87187-87193 which actually \ncalculates out to six not 10 miles. I noted in the mileage logs that Unit #570 driven by \nMcEntire on December 4, 2013 (15 days prior) was 87276 (Addendum 25HH). Also, on \nDecember 19, 2013 from 1500 to 1900 hours, at the same time Casillas was driving it, \nUnit #570 was driven by Flores for a Stone Garden shift. The odometer reading on \nFlores' DAR was 87342.7 to 87357 (Addendum 13M). The mileage log showed Flores \nworked a regular shift and a Stone Garden shift on that day. The first (which was \nindicated as a \"S/G\" shift) showed a starting mileage at 87335.4 and the second which \nindicated as a Beat 3 shift, showed a starting mileage at 87342.7 (Addendum 26E). I \nreviewed Flores' time card and noted that he worked a regular graveyard shift on \nDecember 18, 2013 (Addendum 20C). He clocked in at 6:30 p.m. and out at 7:00 a.m. \nthe next morning on the 19th. He showed clocking back in at 2:23 p.m. and out the \nfollowing morning on December 20, 2013 at 7:00 a.m. Therefore, Flores was driving \nUnit 570 the entire time that Casillas indicated he was driving the same vehicle. \nHowever, Casillas' odometer reading was approximately 150 miles less than Flores' \nreadings. Flores' readings were in a consistent progression from the December 4, 2013 \nodometer reading by McEntire. These mileage readings suggest that Casillas' odometer \nreadings of 87187-87193 were falsified. I further noted that Casillas used the same \nDAR narrative as he did on November 30, December 16 and December 19, 2013, \nCasillas' DAR activity indicated he issued one citation, conducted four field interviews \nand four traffic stops. Spillman showed only one incident for Casillas. It was a fire. The \ncitation query returned no citations written by Casillas. Casillas' time card revealed a \ntime stamp at 2:57 p.m. There was no clock out. Additionally, per the operations plans, \nthe highway interdiction detail had two officers working per day for 10 hour shifts from \n1100-2100. The holiday enforcement detail also had two officers working per day for \n10 hour shifts from 1100-2100. Therefore, Casillas worked three hours in excess of the \nscheduled shifts. \nDecember 20, 2013 \nCasillas worked a four hour Stone Garden shift from 1530 to 1930 hours. December 20, \n2013 was a Friday. His DAR indicated that he drove Unit #570, Ford Crown Victoria for \neight miles. His odometer reading was 87210 to 87218. I noted in the mileage logs that \nUnit #570 driven by IVIcEntire on December 4, 2013 (15 days prior) was 87276 \n(Addendum 25HH). Also, on December 19, 2013 from 1500 to 1900 hours, Unit #570 \n- 19 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER DRS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nwas driven by Flores for a Stone Garden shift. The odometer reading on Flores' DAR \nwas 87342.7 to 87357 (Addendum 13M). The mileage log showed Flores worked a \nregular shift and a Stone Garden shift on that day. The first (which was indicated as a \n\"S/G\" shift) showed a starting mileage at 87335.4 and the second which indicated as a \nBeat 3 shift, showed a starting mileage at 87342.7 (Addendum 26E). Casillas' odometer \nreading was approximately 140 miles less than either of Flores' readings. Flores' \nreadings were in a consistent progression from the December 4, 2013 odometer \nreading by McEntire. These mileage readings suggest that Casillas' odometer reading of \n87210-87218 were falsified. Casillas noted in his DAR that he issued one citation, four \nfield interviews and 4 traffic stops, the exact same activity as December 19, 2013. \nSpillman showed no activity for Casillas during his Stone Garden shift. The citation \nquery returned no citations written by Casillas. Additionally, Casillas' narrative was the \nexact same narrative as his November 30, December 16 and December 19 narratives. I \nnoted on his time card that his time stamp was 3:29 p.m.; there was no other time \nstamp for December 20, 2013. \nDecember 25, 2013 \nCasillas worked a four hour Stone Garden shift from 1500 to 1900 hours. December 25, \n2013 was a Wednesday. His DAR indicated he drove Unit #570 for eight miles. His \nodometer reading was 87210-87218. Casillas' vehicle, mileage and odometer reading \nwere the same as his December 20, 2013 DAR. The mileage log showed that Casillas \ndrove a different unit for Stone Garden, Unit #580 with a starting mileage of 613110 \n(Addendum 26G). Also, on December 25, 2013 from 07004100 hours, four hours \nbefore Casillas started his shift; Unit #570 was driven by Flores for a Stone Garden shift. \nThe odometer reading on Flores' DAR was 87357 to 87377 (Addendum 13M). Casillas' \nodometer reading was approximately 140 miles less than Flores' readings. \nFurthermore, I noted in the mileage logs that Unit #570 driven by McEntire on \nDecember 4, 2013 (15 days prior) was 87276 (Addendum 25HH). Flores' readings \nwere in a consistent progression from the December 4, 2013 odometer reading by \nMcEntire. These mileage readings suggest that Casillas' odometer readings of 87210-\n87218 were falsified. Casillas noted in his DAR that he issued one citation, four field \ninterviews and 4 traffic stops, the exact same activity as December 19 and 20, 2013. \nSpillman showed no activity for Casillas during his Stone Garden shift. Additionally, \nCasillas' narrative was the exact same narrative as his November 30, December 16 and \nDecember 19, 2013 narratives. I noted on his time card that his time stamp was 3:29 \np.m.; there was no other time stamp for December 25, 2013. \nJanuary 2014 (Addenda 14A-F) \nJanuary 15, 2014 \nCasillas worked an eight hour Stone Garden shift from 0700 to 1500 hours. Casillas \nshowed working with Officer Navarro. Casillas and Navarro submitted different DARs \nwith different information. Navarro's DAR showed that he worked from 0730-1530 \nand drove the same vehicle but with different odometer readings. Casillas indicated he \n-20-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \ndrove Unit #527 for 20 miles with an odometer reading of 16000-16020. Navarro also \ndrove Unit #527 but his odometer reading was 12700-12746. I noted in the mileage log \nthat Casillas drove Unit #527 for a regular shift on January 14, 2014 and the starting \nmileage was 12601; which is more consistent with Navarro's odometer readings than \nCasillas'. Casillas' activity on his DAR showed he conducted two vehicle stops, issued \none citation and had three pedestrian contacts. Spillman showed no activity for \nCasillas. The citation query returned no citations written by Casillas. Navarro noted \nthree vehicle stops and 12 field interviews. The Spillman run showed that Navarro \nconducted a traffic stop at 7:56 hours with a verbal warning and a patrol check at 10:10 \nhours at Border Park where two males were contacted. A citation query returned no \ncitations written by Navarro during the shift (Addenda 29A-D). The fact that Casillas \nindicated on his DAR that he worked with Navarro and the citation query showed no \ncitations for either Casillas or Navarro and that Navarro did not indicate that he wrote \nany citations suggests that Casillas falsified his DAR by including a citation that neither \nhe nor Navarro wrote. \nApril 2014 (Addenda 15A-L) \nApril 10. 2014 \nCasillas worked a 12 hour Stone Garden shift from 0600 to 1800 hours. Casillas' DAR \nindicated he drove the white, Crown Vic for 52 miles. I noted that the next two Stone \nGarden shifts, Casillas noted he drove 52 miles. I further noted that Casillas worked \nwith Sergeant German Duran. Casillas' activity for the 12 hour period showed 1 Felony \nPC Arrest. Spillman did not show any activity for Casillas. I reviewed the April 2014 \nStone Garden posted schedule which indicated there were two slots open for each day \nin April 2014 (one officer each time slot). One time slot was for 0700-1500. The other \nwas from 1400-2200. Therefore, Casillas did not work either designated shifts. On his \novertime slip Casillas noted he was working a furlough day. A Spillman run also \nrevealed that Duran did not show any activity for the shift. \nApril 13, 2014 \nCasillas worked a six hour Stone Garden shift from 2000-0200 hours. Casillas noted \nthat he was driving a Black Chevy Tahoe, drove 52 miles and his odometer reading was \n7995-8047. I noted that these were the exact odometer readings for the same vehicle \nas noted on Casillas' April 14, 2014 DAR for Stone Garden overtime. Casillas noted that \nhe drove 52 miles on the previous Stone Garden shift as well as the shift on April 14, \n2014. I noted that Casillas worked with Sergeant German Duran. Casillas' activity for \nthe six hour period showed 1 Felony PC Arrest. Spillman showed Casillas had a Drug \nactivity at 2218 hours. I further reviewed the April 2014 Stone Garden posted schedule \nwhich indicated there were two slots open for each day in April 2014 (one officer each \ntime slot). One time slot was for 07004500. The other was from 1400-2200. \nTherefore, Casillas did not work either designated shifts. \nApril 14, 2014 \n-21-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nCasillas worked a seven hour Stone Garden shift from 1600-2300. Casillas noted that \nhe was driving a Black Chevy Tahoe, drove 52 miles and his odometer reading was \n7995-8047, the exact same odometer reading and mileage as the prior day. This \nsuggested at the least sloppy reporting and possibly falsification of the report. I noted \nthat Casillas worked with Sergeant German Duran. Casillas' activity for the seven hour \nperiod showed 1 Felony PC Arrest. Spillman did not show any activity for Casillas. I \nfurther reviewed the April 2014 Stone Garden posted schedule which indicated there \nwere two slots open for each day in April 2014 (one officer each time slot). One time \nslot was for 0700-1500. The other was from 1400-2200. Therefore, Casillas did not \nwork either designated shifts and worked in excess of one hour of the designated shifts. \nMay 2014 (Addenda 16A-G) \nMay 12, 2014 \nCasillas worked a nine hour Stone Garden shift from 0800 to 1700 hours. Casillas noted \nthat he was drove Unit #571 for 15 miles from 86361 to 86435. Those odometer \nreadings actually calculate to 74 miles. They are also the identical unit, mileage and \nodometer readings that Casillas noted on his May 30, 2014 and June 13, 2014 DARs. \nFurthermore, I noted in the mileage logs that almost a month prior on April 19, 2014 \n(Addendum 26TT), Fraker drove Unit #571 for a regular shift and noted the beginning \nmileage to be 87363. Thereafter, I noted a continuous progression of odometer \nreadings. On April 20, 2014, Fraker noted a reading of 87429 (Addendum 26UU). On \nApril 21, 2014, Fraker noted a reading of 87483. On May 6, 2014, Dominguez noted a \nreading of 87725 (Addendum 26ZZ). On May 13, 2014, Dominguez noted an odometer \nreading of 87853 (Addendum 26BB13). This data suggests that Casillas falsified his \nodometer readings. Casillas showed no activity on his DAR. Spillman showed he \nconducted a follow-up at 9:42 a.m. I found no operation plans for this date. \nMay 30, 2014 \nCasillas worked a nine hour Stone Garden shift from 0730-1630 hours. Casillas noted \nthat he drove Unit #571 for 15 miles with an odometer reading of 86361-86435, the \nsame readings from May 12 and June 13, 2014. Those odometer readings actually \ncalculate to 74 miles. Furthermore, I noted in the mileage logs that almost a month \nprior on April 19, 2014 (Addendum 26TT), Fraker drove Unit #571 for a regular shift \nand noted the beginning mileage to be 87363. Thereafter, I noted a continuous \nprogression of odometer readings, On April 20, 2014, Fraker noted a reading of 87429 \n(Addendum 26UU). On May 23, 2014 Orozco drove Unit #571 for a regular shift with a \nstarting mileage of 88901 (Addendum 26EEE). The next time the vehicle shows on the \nmileage log is June 2, 2014 and was driven by Dominguez with a starting mileage of \n88151 (26HHH). This data confirms that Casillas falsified his odometer readings. \nCasillas showed no activity on his DAR. Spillman showed no activity for Casillas. I also \nnoted that the narrative on Casillas' DAR is the same exact narrative as May 12, 2014 \nwith only a date changed at the beginning. I noted that Casillas' labor distribution does \n-22-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nnot show that he received overtime for this date. I found no operation plans for this \ndate. \nJune 2014 (Addenda 17A-E) \nJune 13, 2014 \nCasillas worked a nine hour Stone Garden shift from 0730 to 1630 hours. His DAR \nshows that he drove a brown Fusion for 15 miles with an odometer reading of 86361-\n86435 which is the exact same mileage as the two May DARs with Unit #571. Those \nodometer readings calculate out to 74 miles, not 15. Casillas showed no activity for the \nshift and Spillman showed no activity for Casillas. Casillas used the same exact \nnarrative as the two May DARs, except that he changed the date. The narrative referred \nto making contact with the same Border Crime Unit USBP agent Fuentes. There is no \ndata available on the brown Fusion but, the odometer readings and the narrative \nsuggests falsification of the DAR. Moreover, there was only one operation plan for June \n2014; Operation Mountain Top. The operation plan showed two eight hour patrol \nofficer shifts per day; one at 1200-2000 hours and the other from 1600-2400 hours. \nThere were also Traffic Controller and Dispatcher details per day. I further noted that \nthere was a comment in the operation plan that stated that \"at the end of the operation \nyou shall have completed the entire Stone Garden Daily Activity Report and Code it as \n\"Mountain Top Operation\" and attached them to the Overtime sheet. If there is any \nincomplete form turned in or you failed to turn in the form, you will be in violation of \nCalexico Police Department Policy Section; 344.1.1-Report Preparation\" (Addenda \n10UUU-10IIII). Casillas did not note on his overtime slip or his DAR that he was \nworking Mountain Top Operation. His narrative was not consistent with the mission of \nOperation Mountain Top. His hours were four and one half hours before the scheduled \nOperation Mountain Top shift. \nJune 30. 2014 \nCasillas worked a four hour Stone Garden shift from 1700 to 2100 hours. I was unable \nto locate a DAR for this date. Casillas submitted an overtime slip for 1700-2100. \nCasillas noted on his overtime slip that he worked Stone Garden/656 Lincoln, Code 5. A \nCode-5 is a stake-out or surveillance. Per M. Gomez, no DAR was submitted but, that \nCasillas worked with Sergeant G. Duran that date. According to his time card, Casillas \nwas paid for the time but the information was not included in the billing summary \nbecause Casillas did not submit a DAR as required. Per Duran's DAR, Duran showed \ndriving the black Chevy Tahoe, an unmarked vehicle. The odometer reading was \nexactly as the previous date for Duran, 12587-12642. Duran's activity for the eight \nhour period showed 1 Felony PC Arrest. Spillman showed no activity for Casillas on \nJune 30, 2014. According to Operation Mountain Top (Addenda 10UUU-IIII), all \npersonnel were required to wear a Class A or Class B Uniform. No other uniform was \nauthorized. Officers were to drive marked units.

Rudy, Sergeant. Calexico Police Department. City of Calexico \nI interviewed Sergeant Rudy Alarcon, Identification No. 515, on Wednesday, July 16, \n2014 at 12:17 p.m., at 608 Heber Avenue, Calexico. The interview was digitally \nrecorded on Digital Record No. 140716-003. Also present in the interview was \nInvestigator Jeri Weinstein, Norman A. Traub Associates. Present as Alarcon's \nemployee representative was Earl Dove, Esq., an attorney with Adams, Ferrone and \nFerrone. Alarcon was given a Lybarger admonishment. \nAlarcon stated that he has been a sergeant in the Calexico Police Department since \nDecember 2013. He has worked for the Calexico Police Department for 13 years and \nsome months. Prior to Calexico Police Department, Alarcon volunteered as an explorer \nwith the California Highway Patrol for approximately four to five years. Prior to law \n-30-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luls CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nenforcement, Alarcon was in the Marine Corps until 2002. Alarcon's MOS was 0811. He \nwas a sergeant artilleryman. Alarcon received leadership courses in the Marine Corps \nbut not in the police department. \nAlarcon said that the overtime policy as he understands it is that it needs to be justified \nand a need for it, Alarcon said that he has been in charge of the Stonegarden federal \ngrant overtime. Alarcon said that the number of slots available was posted on the \nboard; in this case it was for three officers and a dispatcher. Selection is based on \nseniority. Alarcon said that everyone gets to see it and choose the day that fits their \nschedule. \nAlarcon denied that any overtime is granted to individuals before it's posted on the \nboard. Alarcon said that it is posted by a sergeant or a lieutenant. Sergeants Legaspi \nand Uriarte and Lieutenants Serrano and Gerardo have also posted Stone Garden \novertime. \nAlarcon said the policy of posting the overtime has been in practice for about a year. \nAlarcon said the policy changed under Tabarez because under Neujahr, Neujahr \nhandpicked who would work overtime or he would give it to specific officers and they \ngot to choose who would work with them that day on their assignment. Alarcon said \nthat the POA expressed a concern that overtime was not being shared equal for all the \nofficers. \nAlarcon said that justified overtime is for backfill, court, fill in for vacation, and fill in for \nsick and special details. Sometimes, extended watch is justified. Alarcon said the \nmaximum number of hours a day an officer can work on overtime is 16 hours but, when \nhe was assigned to Narcotics, there were times when they worked more than 16 hours. \nAlarcon did not see anything in the policy limiting the number of days in a row an \nemployee can work on overtime. \nBielma, Joe, Police Commissioner. Calexico Police Department. City of Calexico \nI interviewed Police Commissioner Joe Bielma on Tuesday, December 17, 2013, at 12:17 \np.m., at 8100 La Mesa Boulevard, La Mesa. The interview was digitally recorded on \nDigital Record No. 131217-002. \nBielma has been a Police Commissioner for the Calexico Police Department for \napproximately three months and is currently employed as a Special Investigator for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security conducting background investigations. Bielma has \nheld this job for the last three years. Bielma also worked for the Imperial Police \nDepartment and Calexico Police Department for a total of 20 years, retiring at the rank \nof sergeant from the Imperial Police Department. Bielma was a Police Explorer with the \nCalexico Police Department from age 12 to 20 or 21. \n-31-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nBielma stated the Calexico Police Department officers and sergeants would all go to \nsleep after about 2:00 am. The sergeant, who Bielma did not name, would sleep in the \nsally port and the officers would find a place to sleep or go home to sleep. That sergeant \nwould then work overtime to finish the work he did not complete while he was \nsleeping, earning himself the nickname Embezzlement for using overtime money \nprovided by the Stonegarden Program of the Border Patrol. West would not sleep, but \nwould continue to work. West was threatened and told that he needed to stop working \nor \"the boys were gonna get mad at him.\" West continued to work but no one would \nback him up. Bielma said that West jokingly asked Bielma if Bielma would work patrol \nwith him because he needed backup. Bielma said West would call Bielma in the middle \nof the night to ask advice because West's sergeant was not available. \nCeja. M nx cl. k 011m.ce. Officer. Calexico Police Depa: nent. City of Calexico \nI interviewed Police Officer Manuel Ceja, Identification No. S36, on Wednesday, June 4, \n2014 at 10:00 a.m., at 608 Heber Avenue, Calexico. The interview was digitally \nrecorded on Digital Record No. 140604-002. \nCeja started working as a police officer for the City of Calexico in March 2006. He has \nworked in patrol, traffic and as a motor officer. His last position was as an \ninvestigator/detective. Prior to working for Calexico, Ceja worked as a police officer \nwith the Chula Vista Police Department (PD) for 18 months and then as a police officer \nfor the La Mesa PD for one year. Ceja had been on administrative leave since September \n13, 2013\n \nNote: Ceja has since returned to work. \nCeja said that Sergeant Duran is in charge of certain overtime details. Although there \nare no rules about overtime distribution, traditionally, a list of overtime opportunities is \ntaped in the briefing room and it is first come, first served. However, before Duran \nposted the list, Duran would hand select officers that were his favorites, who Ceja once \nwas, and ask them if they could work certain details. Ceja said that absolutely and \nwithout a doubt if you were in with Duran you would get more overtime and if you \nwere out you were not allowed to get overtime. Ceja also said that he was allowed to \nwork two days in a row of overtime because he was favored and those who were not \nwere not allowed to work two days of overtime in a row. Ceja said that officers who are \nout of favor with Duran are Salinas, Marin and guys that Duran disliked. \nGerardo, Gonzalo. Lieutenant. Calexico Police Department. City of Calexico \nI interviewed Lieutenant Gonzalo Gerardo, Identification No. 504, on Thursday, January \n16, 2014, at 12:00 noon, at 211 West Aten Road, Imperial. The interview was digitally \nrecorded on Digital Record No. 140116-003. Gerardo was again interviewed on \n-32-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luis CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nWednesday, July 30, 2014, at 5:10 p.m., at 8100 La Mesa Boulevard, La Mesa. The \ninterview was digitally recorded on Digital Record No. 140730-002. \nGerardo has worked for the Calexico Police Department for more than 22 years. He \nstarted as a police officer, promoted to sergeant in 2001, and promoted to lieutenant in \n2008. Gerardo was promoted to lieutenant under Chief Neujahr. Gerardo was a police \nreserve for Calexico for a year and a half prior to being hired full-time. In 1987 Gerardo \nworked as a Level 1 ranger for the Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotic \nEnforcement, Kemp Program, against marijuana planting in Eureka. \nGerardo stated Calexico Police Department got a new Chief of Police, Tabarez, in June \n2013. Gerardo was the Acting Chief of Police and said the City never told the \nDepartment when they were going to hire Tabarez. Then, one day Gerardo received a \ntelephone call that Tabarez was being sworn in as Chief. At Tabarez' swearing in \nceremony were Sergeant Duran, Sergeant Duran's wife Lilly Duran, Police Officer \nAssociation (POA) President Rudy Alarcon, and City Councilman Castro. Neither \nLieutenants Gerardo and Serrano nor the Executive Assistant to the Chief of Police \nMartha Gomez had prior knowledge of the swearing in. \nOn Tabarez' second day at work, Serrano and Gerardo went to El Centro. While there, \nthey received a text message from Gomez that said she was giving them a heads up that \nthey were going to hate what was going on. When they returned, Tabarez had put out a \nmemo saying that Sergeant Duran was moved out of patrol and was now in charge of \nthe investigations unit. Gerardo said this did not make sense because there were four \npatrol teams and only four patrol sergeants, and Gerardo was in charge of \ninvestigations. \nGerardo said there was no overtime policy. He stated there were Stone Garden sign-up \nsheets, but Uriarte, Alarcon, and Duran did not follow the Stone Garden protocol; they \nwould just come in and work all the overtime they wanted. Gerardo said that their \nactivity sheets for Stone Garden, compared to other people, show no activity. They only \nindicate how much gasoline they used and how many miles they drove, but never any \ntickets, field interviews, or reports. Gerardo said they sit in their offices watching \ntelevision on the computer. Gerardo said he did not think the federal government \naudited the activity sheets because if they did they would put a stop to the Stone Garden \nmoney and make the Department pay everything back. Gerardo indicated it was theft of \npublic funds because they were not doing anything to earn the money. \nLegaspi. Victor, Sergeant. Calexico Police Department. City of Calexico \nLegaspi was interviewed on Thursday, July 31, 2014, at 5:14 p.m. The interview was \nrecorded on Digital Tape Record No. 140731-005. \n-33-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nLegaspi stated Stone Garden is a grant allocated by the US government to the Border \nPatrol. The officers generally work eight-hour shifts, and a memo is posted with the \ndates and times for the shifts. Legaspi stated not everyone follows the times, with the \nbiggest violators being sergeants. Legaspi said the sergeants show up when they want, \nsay they are working Stone Garden, and complete overtime slips. The overtime slips \nare signed off by the lieutenants because the sergeants already worked so they must be \npaid. \nLegaspi stated everyone has the opportunity to work overtime. He said the overtime is \nposted on the board with time periods for the officers to sign up. Legaspi said they try \nto control it so one person does not sign the entire sheet, but there is the bouncing rule \nwhere a senior officer can sign over top of a junior officer. Legaspi said the bouncing \nrule was agreed upon in a staff meeting. He stated he did not agree to it and thought if \nan employee signed up the shift should be theirs. \nGomez, Martha, Executive Assistant to the Chief of Police, Calexico Police \nDepartment, City of Calexico \nI interviewed Executive Assistant to the Chief of Police Martha Gomez on Thursday, \nJanuary 16, 2014, at 10:15 a.m., at 211 West Aten Road, Imperial. The interview was \ndigitally recorded on Digital Record No. 140116-005. Gomez stated she took \nprescription cough syrup at 6:00 am., but was okay to complete the interview. Gomez \nwas again interviewed on Thursday, July 31, 2014 at 12:26 p.m., at 608 Heber Avenue, \nCalexico. The interview was recorded on Digital Tape Record No. 140731-003. \nGomez has worked for the Calexico Police Department since 1987. She started under a \nwork-study program for six months and then got called back to a position in evidence. \nShe worked evidence and records before going to administration. She worked part-\ntime until 1990 when she was hired as a full-time employee. Gomez has been the \nexecutive assistant to eight Chiefs and she is considered a confidential employee \nalthough the City does not recognize that. Gomez has her Associate and Bachelor \ndegrees in psychology and has completed her Master's course work in public \nadministration. \nGomez said she does the billing for the Stone Garden grants at the end of each month. \nShe said she compiles all of the overtime slips that are submitted with the backup \nreport into a spreadsheet. She copies the overtime slips and backup reports, and fills \nout the appropriate form. She then prepares a cover letter for the Chief to sign. \nEverything is taken to the Sheriff's Office because the money is funneled through the \nfeds to the Sheriff's Office. They then wait to be awarded the money. Gomez stated \nunder Chief Neujahr the grant money was \"a free for all.\" Gomez said beginning last \nyear they have special details where Serrano submits an operational plan to the Border \nPatrol for approval. Once it is approved, the sergeant will post the sign-up list for \n-34-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \novertime on a first come first served basis. Gomez said she was not aware of anyone \nsigning up before the list was posted. \nGomez said some officers are very detailed on the backup reports submitted with the \novertime slips while others are very generic. \nGomez stated she also does a report for regular overtime by category that is for the City \nCouncil. Gomez said there is a lot of lack of manpower overtime, a lot of backfill. Gomez \nsaid she knows there has to be a minimum of eight hours between officers' shifts, and \nshe believes there is favoritism in giving out the overtime. Gomez said there are \nsergeants that can just come in and work whenever they want on their days off, and a \nfew of them have been Stone Garden. Gomez said Uriarte comes in whenever he wants \nbut Gomez did not know if Uriarte was working Stone Garden or not. \nSerrano, Jesus, Lieutenant, Calexico Police Department, City of Calexico \nI interviewed Lieutenant Jesus Serrano, Identification No. 503, on Thursday, January 16, \n2014, at 1:45 p.m., at 211 West Aten Road, Imperial. The interview was digitally \nrecorded on Digital Record No. 140116-004. Serrano was again interviewed on \nThursday, July 31, 2014, at 9:02 a.m., at 608 Heber Avenue, Calexico. The interview was \nrecorded on Digital Tape Record No. 140731-002. \nSerrano has worked for the Calexico Police Department for 19 years. He started as a \npolice officer, and in 2000 promoted to sergeant. In 2006 or 2007 he promoted again to \nlieutenant. Prior to joining the Calexico Police Department, Serrano was in the United \nStates Marine Corp. He was active duty from 1989-1993, and in the Reserves from \n2001-2004. Serrano earned his Bachelor's degree in Administration of Justice. \nSerrano is currently in charge of operations. Serrano stated the Department just hired a \nnew Chief of Police, Tabarez. Before Tabarez, the division of work was one lieutenant \nhad two patrol teams and investigations. The other lieutenant had the other two patrol \nteams and administrative duties. Serrano said he has heard that the division of work \nwill change under Tabarez and there will be an administrative lieutenant, Lieutenant \nDuran. \nSerrano stated when Tabarez first became Chief, Tabarez dealt only with Duran and did \nnot pay attention to the lieutenants. Tabarez gave more responsibilities to the \nsergeants without the sergeants reporting to lieutenants. For example, Serrano used to \nbe in charge of training. One day at a staff meeting Tabarez told a sergeant he was now \nin charge of training. Serrano was upset and told the Chief that he, a lieutenant, used to \nbe in charge of training. Tabarez told Serrano that Serrano could continue to keep his \nP.O.S.T. access, but all training responsibilities were the sergeant's. Serrano said he also \nused to review internal affairs investigations but does not have that responsibility any \nmore either. Now, the Chief determines if an internal affairs investigation should take \n-35-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nplace. The Chief assigns it to a sergeant for investigation. Then the completed \ninvestigation is returned to the Chief. Serrano said Tabarez sets policy and the \nsergeants develop it and carry it out. Tabarez is cutting out middle management. \nSerrano felt that if Tabarez was not willing to listen to Serrano then Tabarez did not \nvalue Serrano's opinion so Serrano started keeping his opinions to himself. \nSerrano stated Stone Garden is a federal grant given by the Border Patrol with the \nintention of assisting Border Patrol with crime on the border. Serrano said when an \nemployee works Stone Garden they complete a daily activity report showing all activity \nfor the shift and an overtime slip. The employees are supposed to clock in and out and \nthe shifts are usually eight hours. Serrano stated they want employees to clock in and \nout although it is understandable that people might forget or go end of watch from a \nlocation other than the station. \nI telephonically re-interviewed Serrano on December 9, 2014 at 12:48 hours. The \ninterview was not recorded. Serrano said that the operational plans that he provided in \nNovember 2014 were the only Stone Garden operational plans submitted to him and \ntherefore, the only ones approved to use Stone Garden overtime. Serrano said that \nfrom his recall, all of the operations plans that were submitted were for patrol \noperations and did not include an investigations component. He confirmed that there \nwere no Stone Garden Operation Plans during May 2014, Serrano said that Operation \nMountain Top was published on May 30, 2014 but; details did not start until June 1, \n2014. \nSerrano provided me with copies of all Stone Garden Operations Plans from September \n1, 2013 through October 11, 2014 (Addenda 10A-MMMM). \nMiramon. Leopoldo, Public Safety Dispatcher, Calexico Police Department. City of \nCalexico \nI interviewed Public Safety Dispatcher Leopoldo Miramon on Thursday, November 20, \n2014, at 5:55 p.m., at 420 East Fifth Street, Calexico. The interview was recorded on \nDigital Tape Record No. 141120-004. \nMiramon has been a Dispatcher for the Calexico Police Department for approximately \neight years. Prior to working for the Calexico Police Department, Miramon was a Level \n1 Reserve Police Officer for approximately 12 years for the City of Imperial while \nworking as a newspaper reporter for the Imperial Valley Press. Before that, Miramon \nwas a police explorer for several years. Miramon earned his GED and a certificate of \njournalism from Vanderbilt University. Miramon attended some local colleges and has \nattended numerous trainings for dispatch which certified him as a trainer for dispatch. \nMiramon completed his reserve officer training at a local college. Miramon stated he \n-36-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \ngrew up with law enforcement; his brother, cousin, and uncle were all police officers for \nthe City of Calexico. \nMiramon stated there are currently nine dispatchers and his immediate supervisor is \nCarmen Leon. Above Leon is the sergeant on duty and then a lieutenant. Miramon said \ngenerally officers in the field provide radio transmissions, send instant messages \nthrough the CAD, or text personal cell phones of the dispatchers as a means of \ncommunications. The dispatchers then enter the information received from the officers \ninto the CAD. Miramon stated anything that has to do with work that an officer reports \nto him, including taking lunch or bathroom breaks, he puts into CAD. Miramon said the \nofficers are not required to notify dispatch every time they get out of their patrol \nvehicle, but use their discretion to maintain officer safety. Miramon stated if an officer \nwas just stopping to talk to a family member or friend they would not notify dispatch. If \nit was a matter of immediate importance, like being flagged down, they would notify \ndispatch. Miramon said officers should notify dispatch of traffic stops and field \ninterviews, but it depends on the officer. Miramon stated officers have come into \ndispatch before and told him they did not call information in because they knew the \ndispatchers were busy, while other officers notify dispatch of everything they do. \nMiramon said when an officer starts their shift they notify dispatch, usually over the \nradio, of the vehicle they are driving and the starting mileage. Dispatch then manually \nrecords the information in a notebook by writing the date, officer's name, vehicle \nnumber, unit number, mileage, beat number and the dispatcher's initials. Miramon said \nthe officer tells dispatch which of the four beats they are working: 1) west of the City, \nwest of the railroad tracks 2) north of Fifth Street and east of Mary to Highway 98 3) the \nborder downtown area to Fifth Street, stopping at Mary Avenue and 4) north of \nHighway 98 to the railroad tracks, west to the east City boundaries. Miramon stated if \nan officer is working Stone Garden, the information is recorded the same way except \ninstead of a beat number, the dispatcher will indicate SG. \nMiramon said originally when officers worked Stone Garden; their duties were to take \ncare of the port of entry and any calls at the port of entry regarding any government-\ntype situation or border patrol situation, so he would dispatch those calls to the Stone \nGarden officers. Then, it changed to where the Stone Garden officers were just to do \npreventative patrol, which some officers are very productive at doing and others are \nnot. Miramon stated Stone Garden is patrol so the officers are required to be in uniform \nand drive a police vehicle. Miramon said the last two years the sergeants have been \nworking Stone Garden, and their role was supposed to be exactly the same as an officer \nworking the detail but the sergeants make their own rules. Miramon stated there were \ntimes where Dispatch would have a dispatcher, sometimes Miramon, assigned strictly \nto Stone Garden officers and the dispatcher would do nothing because the officer would \ngo in service and then dispatch would never hear from him again. Miramon stated \nthere is no requirement to provide an end of watch mileage. \n- 37 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luis CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nMiramon said the supervisors would request license plate checks and he would give \nthem the requested information because that was protocol. Miramon said dispatch \nwould run everything they asked whether for a good reason or not, dispatch did not \nknow because they were \"just dispatch.\" Miramon stated this frustrated him because \nhe worked as an officer before and knows they are taking advantage of the situation. \nMiramon stated he wanted to do something about the situation on the department but \nsaid, \"How far would I have gotten? Would I still have my job? No, if I complained \nabout it, you know, would these guys have retaliated against me? Would I have been on \ntheir hit list? I mean, I'm not stupid.\" Miramon further stated he was afraid of the \ndepartment returning to the way it was under Chief Tabarez and it being taken back \nover the way it was before. \nLeon. Carmen, Dispatch Supervisor, Calexico Police Department. City of Calexico \nI interviewed Dispatch Supervisor Carmen Leon on Thursday, November 20, 2014, at \n5:05 p.m., at 420 East Fifth Street, Calexico. The interview was recorded on Digital \nRecord No. 141120-003. \nLeon has worked for the City of Calexico for over 25 years. She started as a dispatcher, \nand at the time there were maybe five dispatchers for police and fire. Over five years \nago, Leon promoted to Dispatch Supervisor where she works all watches on a rotating \nshift and supervises eight dispatchers. Leon is the only Dispatch Supervisor. Leon \ncompleted two years of college. \nLeon described the role of dispatcher as receiving all calls including 911 and office calls, \ndispatching for fire and officers, completing all paperwork for stolen vehicles and \nmissing persons, and running rap sheets. Leon stated the officers have computers with \nCAD capability in their patrol vehicles but, usually they contact dispatch to do runs for \nthem. Leon stated Dispatch also types everything into CAD including the dispositions. \nLeon stated if an officer issues a citation, the officer tells Dispatch and Dispatch puts it \ninto the CAD system. Only if there is an arrest along with the citation will the officer \nprovide Dispatch with the cite number and court date, which will also be put into CAD, \nIf an officer completes a field interview (FI) and notifies Dispatch, Dispatch will indicate \n\"subject FI\" in CAD. Leon said she tries to put everything an officer tells her into the \ncomments. \nLeon said when an officer works Stone Garden overtime, most of the time they log on at \nthe start of their shift. Leon stated she is usually aware of who is working Stone Garden \nbecause she has seen the sign-up sheet or the sergeant has told her. The officer is \nsupposed to provide unit, mileage, and that they are working Stone Garden. When a \nsergeant works Stone Garden, they are supposed to be doing the same work a police \nofficer does for Stone Garden, including notifying Dispatch of all police activities. \n-38-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nLeon stated the employees that work Stone Garden seem to have the energy to do it, \nwith the exception of the sergeants. Leon said Sergeants Marquez, Duran, Alarcon, \nMarduefio, Legaspi and Uriarte are not very active. Leon stated the sergeants will back \nup officers, but their mentality stays as a sergeant. Leon said it is very rare if a sergeant \nwill stop someone while working Stone Garden. \nLeon stated that officers were not required to give mileage at the end of their shifts. \nLeon stated everyone's mileage is handwritten in a log in dispatch, but if an employee \ndoes not call the information in, it does not get recorded. \nLeon stated Calexico uses the Spillman CAD System from which she can run a report for \nan officer on a specific day. Leon reviewed a Calexico Police Department Law Incident \nSummary Report. Leon said counter traffic meant he helped someone who came in to \nthe counter. Leon did not know what the code FD meant. She stated 1182 was either \nan accident or a civil matter. Office information was information he wanted the office to \nknow about. Leon said lost property incidents are usually at the counter. An AVR is \nwhen a broadcast is made over the radio for all Valley agents. She stated CT was \ncounter traffic, and she did not know what 314.1 meant. Leon said \"act\" meant active, \nCLO meant closed, and CAA meant closed with an adult arrest. \nLeon felt that the sergeants were allowed to work overtime without doing work \nbecause they were close with the Chief. Leon said Chief Tabarez let them do it even \nthough she did not see the Chief around when the sergeants were working Stone \nGarden, Leon said no one ever conducted an off-hours inspection or checked their time. \nLeon stated she really noticed the sergeants not doing anything because she was \nshorthanded in dispatch but could not get Stone Garden funds for dispatch. She noticed \n\"because they were not doing nothing and we needed help in here and they're getting \npaid money and we had to suffer over here and do all the extra work with extra bodies \nout there.\" Leon stated the sergeants did not deserve the Stone Garden money because \nthey were not active. \nTabarez, Pompeyo, Chief of Police, Calexico Police Department, City of Calexico \nI interviewed Chief of Police Pompey() Tabarez, Identification No. 500, on Tuesday, July \n8, 2014, at 10:02 am., at 608 Heber Avenue, Calexico. Present as Tabarez' attorney was \nRobert W. Krause, of Bobbitt, Pinkard and Fields. The interview was recorded on \nDigital Record No. 140708-002. Tabarez was given a Lybarger admonishment. Tabarez \nrefused a request to re-interview him on December 3, 2014. \nTabarez became the Chief of Police for the Calexico Police Department on June 25, 2013. \nPrior to working for the Calexico Police Department, Tabarez worked for the Imperial \nCounty Sheriff's Office for 32 years, and retired in 2012 at the rank of sergeant. Prior to \nthat, Tabarez worked approximately one year with the Westmoreland Police \n- 39 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nDepartment and three years with the Calexico Police Department. Tabarez earned a \nBachelor of Science degree in business administration and attended the California \nPeace Officer Standards and Training Manager's Course. \nTabarez stated he has six sergeants, two lieutenants, and an administrative assistant. \nTabarez developed a three tier-down command structure. He has an operational \ncommander, an administrative commander, and an investigation commander. The \ncommander positions are the rank of lieutenant, but Tabarez has not been able to fill \nthe investigation commander position with a lieutenant. Sergeant Duran currently fills \nthat position. \nTabarez stated the Department did not have an overtime policy but there was an \novertime practice. Later in the interview Tabarez said there might be an overtime \npolicy but he would have to look it up. He said the list is posted and the bidding process \nis followed for the list. Tabarez said before he became Chief, the culture used to be that \neverybody assigned their overtime to whomever, but he mandated the posting of the \nlist and the bidding. Tabarez stated his direction was you sign up for the overtime, and \nthen once everybody's got a time, you can come back to it. Tabarez said he knew his \ndirection was being followed because he gave the directive, verbally, to the sergeants \nand the lieutenants. Tabarez said he knows his direction is being followed because of \nthe trust factor. He stated all involved are sworn peace officers and they follow \ndirection. Tabarez said he does not audit overtime because everything seems pretty \nnormal and working fine, and nobody makes any allegations about it. When asked if \nthere was a possibility that sergeants were giving overtime to certain people before \nthey posted the list, Tabarez responded, \"No, there's not.\" He stated it could never \nhappen in his organization because of trust. \nTabarez said he does not limit the number of hours of overtime an officer can work \nbecause he has to fill the spots. He said regularly he cannot find officers to fill the \novertime and sometimes has to order people to come to work on overtime. Tabarez \nsaid they do have the 8-hour turn around standard that everybody else has, and he \nbelieved that was a written policy. \nTabarez stated he knows how much overtime is used for what purpose and who his \nhighest overtime employees are because they do a report. Tabarez said his highest \novertime employees were Alarcon, Duran, Legaspi, and Uriarte. \nTabarez said he knows that the overtime being worked is appropriate because it has a \ncode. Tabarez said he has no one that engineers overtime but if he did that would be \nthe sergeant's problem. Tabarez stated his employees do not have to engineer overtime \nbecause they have nonstop overtime. Tabarez further said he did not know of anybody \ninappropriately submitting overtime and it has not been an allegation or discovered. \nTabarez said his sergeants are aware that they are accountable for the overtime, and \nthey submit weekly and daily reports on overtime activities on their shifts. Tabarez \n-40-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nsaid everybody is part of the system, but he is specifically responsible for monitoring \novertime usage. \nTabarez did not know how long overtime slips were maintained because payroll \nmaintained them. He believed they should be kept for five years, but did not know what \npractices payroll followed. Tabarez stated his executive assistant was responsible for \nensuring overtime slips were submitted with the time cards. Tabarez said his executive \nassistant had been working there for approximately 20 years and that is her \nresponsibility so that is how he knows it is happening. \nTabarez said his overtime budget was $450,000 but he went over budget this year by \n$500,000. Tabarez said the Department has an allocation of 31 officers but has been \nworking with 25. He said instead of paying for the 6 positions they are paying overtime \nto guard those 6 positions. Tabarez stated the overtime budget might have gone up \n$500,000 but they were saving on the 6 positions. Tabarez said he fulfilled the needs \nand the requirements. Tabarez stated in addition to his overtime budget he had funding \nfrom the Border Patrol of anywhere between $250,000 and $500,000 a year for \novertime to be used for special operations on the border area. \nUriarte. Frank, Sergeant, Calexico Police Department City of Calexico \nI interviewed Sergeant Frank Uriarte, Identification No. 514, on Wednesday, July 16, \n2014 at 2:57 p.m., at 608 Heber Avenue, Calexico. The interview was digitally recorded \non Digital Record No. 140716-004. Also present in the interview was Investigator Jeri \nWeinstein, Norman A. Traub Associates. Present as Uriarte's employee representative \nwas Earl Dove, Esq., an attorney with Adams, Ferrone and Ferrone. Uriarte was given a \nLybarger admonishment. \nUriarte has worked with the Calexico Police Department since 2000. Uriarte has been a \nsergeant for seven years and promoted to sergeant in 2006. Uriarte has worked all in \npatrol. Uriarte stated that he currently conducts IA's as a collateral duty. He is also \nresponsible for recruitments and training. Uriarte stated that Alarcon is currently the \nFTO Sergeant. Uriarte said he has attended supervisory courses but, could not recall \nwhat courses. The last time he attended a course was about two years prior. \nUriarte said that he was recently assigned as the IA sergeant. Internal Affairs \ninvestigations are assigned to him by the chief directly or the chief will tell Sergeant \nDuran or maybe Lieutenant Serrano to open up an IA regarding a complaint and assign \nit to him. When that happens, Uriarte gets a folder with the complaint and he starts to \nwork on it. \nUriarte said that every time there is a change in administration, there are new \nindividuals that the chief trusts or goes to all the time. Chief Tabarez looks favorably \nupon Sergeant Duran. \n-41-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luis CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nI, along with John Capen, re-interviewed Sergeant Frank Uriarte, Employee \nIdentification No. 514, on Wednesday, December 3, 2014, at 3:45 p.m., at 420 East Fifth \nStreet, Calexico. Attorney Kristopher Di Giovanni with the firm Adams, Ferrone, and \nFerrone was present as Uriarte's representative. The interview was recorded on Digital \nTape Record No. 141203-003. Uriarte was given a Lybarger admonishment. \nUriarte stated from September 2013 to June 30, 2014, his responsibilities were mainly \npatrol. Uriarte was also responsible for the reserve program and was in charge of the \nrange, the Taser program, getting together a SWAT team and SWAT Manual, Internal \nAffairs, recruitment, backgrounds, training, and dealing with P.O.S.T.-related issues. \nUriarte stated once Alarcon was promoted to Sergeant, in January or February, Uriarte \ntalked to Tabarez about Alarcon being responsible for the Reserve Officer Program. In \nJune or July, when Marduetio was promoted to Sergeant, Uriarte talked to Tabarez \nabout Marduefio being responsible for the range, Taser, and SWAT. Uriarte kept \nInternal Affairs, recruitment, backgrounds, training and P.O.S.T. along with patrol \nsupervisor. Uriarte stated he received no additional pay for his collateral duties, but \nworked quite a bit of overtime to complete the work. \nUriarte stated as a supervisor one of his duties is to review and approve overtime for \nhis shift. Uriarte stated he approved overtime for such things as short staffing and \nextended watch. Uriarte said when an officer works extended watch the next shift \nsupervisor would sign the overtime slip. Uriarte said he approves overtime after it has \nbeen worked, so he does not ask the officer if the officer worked the day prior or how \nmany hours. Uriarte stated there has not been an issue with officers working an \nexcessive amount \nUriarte said there is no way to verify, 100 percent, that officers actually do the overtime \nwork because you cannot watch someone 100 percent of the time. Uriarte stated you \nhave to take people by their word, but if he sees a discrepancy he gets to the bottom of \nit. \nUriarte said for an employee to get paid for overtime they must complete and sign an \novertime slip indicating they worked the hours, the slip must be signed by a supervisor, \nand then one copy goes to administration, one copy is placed with the time card, and \nthe employee keeps a copy. Uriarte stated the overtime slips are signed by a lieutenant \nwhenever the lieutenant gets the slips. Uriarte did not know exactly what happened to \nthe overtime slips for administration, but thought they were filed. \nUriarte stated all Department employees are required to clock in and out every day \nunless they are working outside of the City or have court. Uriarte stated officers are not \nallowed to clock in or out for others and he has never heard of instances where that \noccurred. For employees that do not clock in and out, overtime is verified when they \nattach a subpoena from court or by their word. Uriarte stated some officers clock in \n- 42 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luis CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nbefore they get dressed and others get dressed and then clock in. Uriarte said he would \nexpect patrol officers to show roughly 12-hours worked on their time card, give or take \nfive minutes. \nUriarte later stated the time card system was not really accurate because things happen. \nHe said there are times where an officer has clocked out and then he gets a call or has to \nmeet with someone. Uriarte said he supposed the employee could go and clock back in, \nbut no one did that. Uriarte stated the same thing occurs before clocking in, where he \ngets tasked with work. Uriarte said the time card was a guideline. \nUriarte stated it is the supervisor's responsibility to complete time cards for the \nofficers. Uriarte said he reviews the time cards and overtime slips and then adds up the \nhours and notes it at the bottom of the column on the time card. Gomez then picks up \nthe time cards and reviews them. Uriarte stated if there were 30 minutes or more \ndiscrepancy between the time card and overtime slip he would have the officer explain \nthe discrepancy. \nUriarte stated Stone Garden overtime changed from Chief to Chief. Uriarte said under \nChief Neujahr they worked Stone Garden to fill patrol during furloughs. The officers \nwould work a 12-hour shift in patrol using Stone Garden overtime. Under Chief \nTabarez the officers were paid during furlough time with asset forfeiture money. \nUriarte did not know if Stone Garden could be used to pay for furlough days, but simply \ntook direction from the Chief. \nUriarte said he never saw the MOU between the Border Patrol and Calexico Police \nDepartment, but his understanding was Stone Garden dealt with alien smuggling, drug \nenforcement, and any other issues along the border and was paid by Homeland \nSecurity. Uriarte said the lieutenant would determine the operation for the month. \nUriarte stated each team would work one Stone Garden operation per pay period and \nthe lieutenant would ask for an operational plan, which Uriarte would complete for his \nteam. On Uriarte's team day to work Stone Garden, they would work based on the \noperational plan he put together. \nUriarte stated when he works Stone Garden he is in uniform as are most employees \nwho work it. He said the exceptions would be Investigations or when the operational \nplan was for surveillance. Uriarte said when he works Stone Garden it is normally as a \nsupervisor but he is available to get dispatched calls. \nUriarte stated it was common for officers to work a 12-hour shift in patrol followed by a \nfew hours of Stone Garden overtime. Uriarte said that happened when there were sign-\nup sheets for Stone Garden, because officers would call in sick and not work the shifts \nthey had signed up for. Uriarte said when that occurred; anyone that wanted to stay \nover and work the available shift could do so with shift supervisor approval. Uriarte \nstated he worked overtime in this capacity as well. \n-43-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER, LUIS CAS1LLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nUriarte reviewed the Stone Garden Daily Activity Report (DAR) form and indicated the \nform must be completed every time an officer works Stone Garden overtime. He said it \nwas required by the Department and Stone Garden got a copy too. Uriarte said he \nthought the form was used for statistics. Uriarte stated the officer must complete their \nname, overtime hours, number of hours, pay rate, overtime rate, car you are driving, \nbeginning mileage, ending mileage, total miles, statistics, and narrative. Uriarte said the \nnarrative section was where the officer could describe what went on that day, which is \nusually consistent with the operational plan. Uriarte stated under Chief Neujahr an \nofficer would handle a lot of patrol calls that were not Stone Garden work. \nUriarte said in the statistics section he would expect an officer to indicate what they did \nand what they assisted on. Uriarte stated if an officer conducted a vehicle stop they \nshould put a \"1\" in the box. If an officer assisted on a vehicle stop they should also put a \n\"1\" in the box. Uriarte said there was no way to differentiate between assisting and \nactually doing it yourself. Uriarte stated work gets counted twice but that is the way it \nhas always been. \nUriarte stated if an officer conducts a vehicle stop it is good practice to notify \ncommunications, but it does not always happen. Uriarte stated there was a policy or \nprocedure requirement but they had not been following it consistently over the past \nyears. Uriarte said officers do not notify dispatch because they get lazy and feel the stop \nwill be no big deal. Uriarte said if an officer called in their stops it would be recorded in \nthe Spillman CAD system. \nSubject Employee Interview \nCasillas, Luis, Police Officer. Calexico Police Department. City of Calexico \nI interviewed Police Officer Luis Casillas, Badge Number 545, on Thursday, January 29, \n2015, at 9:50 a.m., at 420 East 5th Street, Calexico. Present as Casillas' employee \nrepresentative was Attorney Kristopher Di Giovanni with Adams Ferrone. The \ninterview was recorded on Digital Tape Record No. 150129-002. Casillas was given a \nLybarger admonishment by Lieutenant Jesus Serrano who left the room immediately \nfollowing the admonishment. \nCasillas stated that he was hired by the Calexico Police Department in August 2008, and \nworked patrol until June 2014 when Casillas went to the Detective Bureau. \nNote: Department records revealed that Casillas was appointed as an \ninvestigator on April 2, 2014, \nCasillas stated while working patrol, the officer with the most Calexico Police \nDepartment seniority on the team was the Officer in Charge (OIC), Since Casillas was at \n- 44 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nthe bottom of the seniority list, most of the time he was not the OIC. Casillas drove a \nblack and white patrol vehicle but did not recall which unit number he used most often. \nCasillas stated he received a five percent special pay increase when he was transferred \nto Detective Bureau. Casillas stated in Detective Bureau he did basic detective work and \nattended a one-week detective school at Carlsbad Police Department. As an \ninvestigator Casillas had a take-home vehicle, a gray Ford Fusion. Casillas was placed \non administrative leave on October 30, 2014, and has been off since that date. \nCasillas stated when he worked patrol, he would first walk into the station and \"shoot \nthe shit\" with people. Casillas described himself as in between a last-minute person and \none that gets to work 15 minutes early. If he remembered he would then clock in, but \nhe would sometimes get sidetracked and forget to clock in. He would then go to the \nlocker room and dress as he never came to work in uniform. He attend roll call and got \nassigned his beat and then checked his patrol vehicle and his weapons. Casillas would \nthen notify dispatch of his assigned beat, his unit number and mileage. Casillas stated \nnotifying dispatch was hit and miss, and occurred approximately 50 percent of the time, \ndue to bad habits and just human nature. \nCasillas said the Mobile Digital Terminals (MDTs) in the older patrol vehicles tended to \nwork more often than the MDTs in the new vehicles. Casillas stated he would try to use \nthe MDT but after a few tries he would give up, SP sometimes he used it and sometimes \nhe did not. Casillas stated he was not a \"techie guy\" and did not remember the process \nto turn on and off the MDT. He did recall that he had a login and password where he \nentered his first initial and last name followed by the first three letters of his last name \nand the last four numbers of his social security number. Casillas stated the new cars \nhad in-car video and some of the cameras worked and some did not. He further stated \nthe new cars had audio in the back but only some of those worked as well. Casillas was \nnot trained on the recording equipment and anytime he needed a copy of a recording he \nwould go through Steven Frazier or Lieutenant Gerardo. Casillas stated he did not \nrecall ever reviewing video footage of himself. Casillas said he used the new patrol \nvehicles for approximately four or five months before going to Detective Bureau. \nCasillas was asked if COBAN system videos were pulled for the vehicles he indicated on \nhis logs, for the dates and times indicated on his logs, and the officer was not him would \nhe be able to explain the inconsistency. Casillas stated he would not be able to explain \nit. Casillas stated he did not specifically recall but he might have used another officer's \nlog in information to log into COBAN or the in-car video system if his password was not \nworking. \nCasillas stated if he was driving around on patrol and observed a traffic violation he \nwould call out what he had, license plate or vehicle description and his location. \nCasillas said there were times when he did not notify dispatch of his traffic stops \nbecause there was emergency radio traffic or multiple units working overtime. Casillas \n-45-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nstated 90 percent of the time he notified dispatch of his stops because it was good \nofficer safety. Casillas stated he was sure there was a policy or procedure that required \nan officer to call everything in but he did not know it offhand. \nCasillas said they have field interview (FI) cards but they do not always use them. \nCasillas stated he usually jots down FI information on his notepad or announces the \ninformation over the air. Then he gives whoever is inquiring about the information the \npage from his notebook or they could pick up a printout from dispatch at the station. \nCasillas described his notepad as small, in a leather wallet, that fits in his pocket. \nCasillas stated nothing else was done with the F1 information, it was not maintained \nanywhere. \nCasillas stated the overtime policy stated an officer could work a maximum of 16 hours \nwith 8 hours between shifts. Casillas said there could be exceptions to the policy, but \ndid not recall doing it himself although he stated there could be a possibility he did. \nCasillas said he heard supervisors tell officers that they needed to go home because \nthey did not have 8 hours between shifts, but he was never told that. Casillas stated he \nwas sure there was a policy that limited work hours in a 3-day, 5-day, or 7-day period \nbut he could not remember it offhand. Casillas said he was not a big overtime guy. \nCasillas stated to complete an overtime slip you put your name (he would put his initial \nand last name) and division and complete the check boxes. Casillas stated if you were in \ncourt you checked the court box and indicated how many hours worked. If the \novertime was Stone Garden grant then you checked the grant box and overtime box, \nindicated how many hours, and wrote and circled the number 88 in the payroll code \nbox. You then indicated your assignment, day you worked, hours you worked, total \nhours, and then indicated what type of compensation you preferred. The employee \nsigns the slip and gives it to the supervisor for signature. The person requesting \novertime would then keep the blue copy. Casillas said that by signing the overtime slip, \nthe employee was indicating they worked that day and those hours. \nCasillas stated half hour increments of time were used for overtime slips. Casillas \nstated, \"I would assume that if you wanted to, you know, nickel and dime 'em for 15 \nminutes, you could but it, it just becomes a, a nightmare.\" Casillas did not know offhand \nwhat the policy and procedure was on how much time had to be worked to put in for 15 \nminutes of overtime. Casillas said if an employee was 10 or 15 minutes late for a shift \nthey took it upon themselves to stay the extra 10 or 15 minutes at the end. Casillas \nstated there have been situations where officers signed up for a 10-hour overtime shift \nbut were released early. In those situations, overtime slips were submitted for the \nhours actually worked not for the hours scheduled to work. \nCasillas said the practice if you had a late report was to advise the person in charge of \nthe shift that your report was going to put you overtime and get approval to stay. \nCasillas stated each supervisor was different, whether they would sign the overtime slip \n- 46 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nor not, so he would just find a supervisor that would sign. Casillas said if the sergeant \nwho was working when the overtime was completed would not sign the overtime slip \nhe would take it to his supervisor the next day for signature. Casillas stated he did not \nrecall submitting overtime slips without a supervisor's signature, but he assumed there \ncould be some times where it happened. \nCasillas stated overtime slips are due the Tuesday before the last day of the pay period. \nCasillas said some officers held onto their overtime slips and then on Tuesday were \nrunning around getting them signed and submitted. Then it was implemented that all \nslips had to be in by 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday. It became common practice, if an officer \nwas working overtime past or after 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, to complete the overtime \nslip and submit it before working the overtime so that it would appear on the paycheck. \nCasillas stated if the officer did not end up working the overtime, he assumed the \nofficer's paycheck would be docked the next time. Casillas stated he usually sees about \nthe same amount of money all the time on his paychecks so if his paycheck looked off it \nwould be his obligation to say something because he did not work for the extra pay. \nCasillas could not recall a situation where that happened to him. \nCasillas stated Stone Garden was a federal grant managed by the County through the \nBorder Patrol for border crimes that happen within the proximity of the border. \nCasillas said the money has been used in a lot of different ways, and at one point was \nused to supplement patrol. Casillas said a couple of years ago the officers were \nfurloughed 12 hours each pay period. Instead of 80 hours of pay they were getting 68 \nhours of pay. The officers would work an 8-hour Stone Garden overtime shift to \nsupplement the patrol force and at the same time would balance out the missing 12 \nhours of pay from their paychecks. Casillas stated there was a time when they had to go \nto the Border Patrol station for their roll call. Then there was a time when they would \ncomplete a Stone Garden sheet and have the Border Patrol supervisor sign it. There \nwas a time when they would put five names on the sheet and everyone's hours and the \nBorder Patrol would sign it, which was then changed to one officer per report. Casillas \nsaid there was a possibility that asset forfeiture funds were being used to supplement \nfurlough days as well. \nCasillas said after furloughs ended, sign-up sheets were hung on the board for Stone \nGarden overtime shifts. Casillas stated, \"It was kind of like a Stone Garden buffet I \ncalled it, you know, and some guys signed up for the Stone Garden and some guys \ndidn't.\" Casillas said in the beginning there were rules such as if you signed up but did \nnot show up for your shift you would get written up. After that, if you signed up people \nwith more seniority had two days to cross your name out and take your spot. Some lists \nhad a spot for a supervisor to sign up, but if no supervisor wanted it an officer would \nsign up instead. Then just before the shift the supervisor would decide to work and \nbump the officer out of the overtime. Sometimes no supervisor worked the shift. \nCasillas stated a lot of officers worked Stone Garden every day they had off. Casillas \n-47-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nemployee completes for warrants, arrests, citations, vehicle searches, etc. Casillas said \nthe number of vehicle searches recorded were the number you conducted or assisted \nwith. The number of citations issued would be the number you issued or assisted with. \nField interviews would be the same. Casillas said by looking at the DAR there is no way \nto know the difference between the number he actually conducted and the number he \nassisted with. Casillas admitted this caused a possibility of duplication of statistics. \nCasillas said 'IA turned over to BP' was used when you contacted an illegal \nundocumented alien and turned the person over to the Border Patrol. Casillas stated \nyou enter the badge number of the Border Patrol agent you turned the person over to. \nCasillas stated when an employee submits an overtime slip and a DAR it is expected that \nthe information on both is consistent, along with the timecard, but he is sure it does not \nalways work that way. Casillas said he is sure he has submitted overtime slips that \nwere inconsistent with his DARs because he makes lots of mistakes. Casillas said the \nDAR is supposed to be filled out completely but oftentimes, due to bad habits and poor \nrecordkeeping that does not happen. Casillas stated to his knowledge nothing happens \nif it is not filled out completely. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated November 6, for the hours of 1500 to 1900. There was \nno year in the date box, but Casillas noted the year 2013 was in the header of the report. \nCasillas acknowledged it was his name on the report and the report indicated unit 570 \nwas a Crown Victoria. Casillas said he logged the starting mileage as 137,796 and the \nending mileage as 137,859 for a total of 20 miles. Casillas said he did not put in the \ncorrect total miles because of sloppy recordkeeping, and that he made a mistake. \nCasillas stated his signature was on the overtime slip for November 6, 2013, for four \nhours of overtime. He stated his signature indicated the overtime was required and his \nslip was accurate. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated November 8, 2013, and stated because his name was on \nit he assumed it was his. The DAR indicated four citations, eight Fls and five traffic \nstops. Casillas said although he would expect if someone looked into the system \nsomeplace they could locate the work he did, it might not necessarily be in there. \nCasillas stated he might have used an old template and just left the numbers in there \nfrom a prior shift. Casillas further stated one would expect the mileage on the DAR to \nmatch the mileage on either the mileage log or somewhere else, but he might have \nmade a mistake or used a sloppy template. Casillas stated for the starting mileage he \nsometimes takes the number from the odometer, or he guesstimates at the end of the \nshift by noting the ending mileage and taking a stab at how many miles he drove. \nCasillas said a lot of times he was too lazy to check the car for the miles and would just \nguess or use an old template. Casillas stated he had no clue what the mileage was used \nfor other than he needed to complete the boxes on the report to get paid for the \novertime. Casillas believed that when he filled out the report it was supposed to be \naccurate, but he made lots of mistakes. Casillas stated it was his signature on an \n- 49 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luis CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \novertime slip for November 8, 2013, and that his signature indicated he worked four \nhours of required overtime and the slip was accurate. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated November 30, 2013, for the hours 1500 to 2300. The \nDAR indicated unit 570 with the starting mileage of 87,175 and ending mileage of \n87,187. Casillas stated he was not good with math, but thought the total mileage of 15 \nas indicated on the DAR was not accurate. Casillas stated he could not recall specifically \nwhat happened that night, but he might have made a mistake doing the math. When \nasked why the mileage was different (87,000 at the end of November and 137,000 \nearlier in the month) Casillas stated he probably used a template and made a mistake. \nCasillas stated, \"I probably failed to properly fill that out correctly.\" Casillas reviewed a \nsigned overtime slip for November 30, 2013 and confirmed it was his signature. \nCasillas stated his signature meant the eight hours of overtime was required and his slip \nwas accurate. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated December 4, 2013, that was handwritten and confirmed \nit was his. The DAR indicated he drove unit 580, a Crown Victoria, with the starting \nmileage of 59,975 and the ending mileage of 59,982 for a total of 7 miles. Casillas \nreviewed the dispatch log, called 25HH, and noted his name was on December 4, 2013, \nwith unit 580, a starting mileage of 59, 935, and SG for Stone Garden. Casillas stated he \nmight have again made a mistake when recording the mileage. Casillas was asked if as a \nsupervisor he would be concerned if one of his employees had reports with consistent \nmistakes on them. Casillas replied, \"Maybe that's why I'm not a supervisor.\" Casillas \nfurther stated if you looked at everyone's Stone Garden sheets there would be millions \nof mistakes. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated December 5, 2013, and stated it had his name on it and \nwas written in his handwriting. Casillas said the report indicated he drove unit 571, but \nthere was no starting, ending, or total miles completed. Casillas stated he \"half-assed it\" \nand by putting lines through those boxes knew that he did not enter the required \ninformation. Casillas stated the report indicated he worked from 1300 hours until 1900 \nhours that night which is a total of 6 hours, but the DAR indicates a total of 4 hours. \nCasillas reviewed his overtime slip for December 5, 2013 and noted it was for 4 hours. \nCasillas said he made a mistake on the total hours, but also noted the date was not in his \nhandwriting. Casillas concluded he must have left it blank and another person filled it \nin. Casillas stated he failed to complete the appropriate date and hours. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated December 6, 2013, with his name on it that appeared to \nbe his. The DAR indicated he drove unit 580, a Crown Victoria, but there was no \nstarting mileage or ending mileage indicated. Casillas reviewed the dispatch log, called \n26B, and saw it recorded him driving unit 571 with a starting mileage of 85,900 and \nworking Stone Garden. When asked to explain how the DAR could say he drove 580 \nand the dispatch log said he drove 571, Casillas stated he made a mistake and was not \npaying attention when he completed his DAR. \n-50-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY PoLicE OFFICER Lots CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated December 14, 2013 and indicated it was his. The DAR \nindicated he drove unit 582, a Crown Victoria, with a starting mileage of 97,000 and an \nending mileage of 97,011 for a total of 11 miles. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated December 15, 2013 with his name on it. The DAR \nindicated he again drove unit 582 with a starting mileage of 97,011 and an ending \nmileage of 97,027. Casillas stated he did not recall what happened but that he made a \nmistake. Casillas reviewed the dispatch log and noted Officer Frazier was driving unit \n582 on December 15, 2013 and had a starting mileage of 85,765. When asked how \nCasillas had two consecutive days of mileage at 97,000 and Frasier had the same vehicle \nmileage at 85,765, Casillas stated he improperly completed the DAR and it was another \nmistake on the template. When asked how it was a mistake when the mileage ended \none day at 97,011 and started the next day at 97,011, Casillas stated he could not recall \nthat specific date but it was either a mistake or a guess. Casillas said none of it was \nintentional. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated December 16, 2013, for the hours 1300 to 0100. Casillas \nstated it was his name on the report and the report indicated he drove unit 582, a \nCrown Victoria, with the starting mileage of 91,110 and the ending mileage of 91,120. \nCasillas said the mileage did not look consistent with the mileage two days earlier at \n97,000. Casillas stated he improperly completed the DAR and made a mistake. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated December 17, 2013, and said it indicated he drove unit \n582 with the starting mileage of 91,120 and the ending mileage of 91,123. Casillas \nstated he made a mistake completing the DAR, but he could not go back to 2013 and \nprovide an answer as to why he did it. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated December 18, 2013, for the hours of 1500 to 2300. The \nDAR has a note indicating the correct date should be December 19, 2013. The DAR \nindicates Casillas drove unit 570 with a starting mileage of 87,187, an ending mileage of \n87,193, for a total of 10 miles. Casillas stated it appeared the mileage was off and he \nmade a mistake with both the mileage and the total miles. Casillas was asked if he was \nconcerned because his start mileage on December 19, 2013, was the same as he \nrecorded on November 30, 2013. Casillas stated he was not concerned and it was just a \nmistake or poor recordkeeping. Casillas said he could not recall that day in 2013. \nCasillas noted there were two times in December when Victor Flores used unit 570, and \nFlores signed on with the mileage 87,335.4 and later the same day for overtime with \n87,342.7. \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated December 20, 2013, with his name on it and noted he \nused unit 570. The starting mileage was 87,210 and the ending mileage was 87,218 for \na total of 8 miles. Casillas stated he did not remember this date, but he had poor \nrecordkeeping skills. \n-51-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nCasillas reviewed a DAR dated December 25, 2013, where he drove unit 570 with a \nstarting mileage of 87,210 and an ending mileage of 87,218 for a total of 8 miles. \nCasillas stated he could not explain why the mileage was the same as on December 20, \n2013 other than he made a mistake when completing the DARs. \nCasillas took a short break to meet with his attorney, and upon return to the interview \nAttorney Kristopher Di Giovanni stated, \"My client feels that he doesn't have any \nindirect, independent recollection of any of these DARs in 2013 and if there are \ninaccurate, inaccuracies, his stance is that it was an inadvertent mistake on his part and \nsloppy rec, recordkeeping and in no way was it done intentionally, urn, or fraudulently.\" \nWhen told there were concerns with DARs through June 30, 2014, Casillas stated he \nwould have the same response for all of them and there was no need to continue to go \nthrough each one, his answer would just be the same over and over again. \nCasillas reviewed an overtime slip dated April 10, 2014 and stated it was his. Casillas \nstated it was his writing that indicated furlough, probation sweeps, and Stone Garden \non the slip. Casillas noted the slip was not signed by a supervisor but said he had no \nclue why he would not have had it signed. Casillas stated he did not recall putting in for \nfurlough days and he did not recall that specific date. \nCasillas stated oftentimes there were not enough vehicles for everyone so he would \nwork Stone Garden with two people in one vehicle. Casillas said he did not remember a \nparticular day in June 2014 when he worked Stone Garden with Sergeant Duran, but he \ndid have recollection of working Stone Garden with Duran on occasion. Casillas did not \nrecall which car they drove, but said he could have been in Duran's black Chevy Tahoe. \nCasillas stated when he worked with Duran sometimes Casillas would complete the \nDAR and sometimes Duran would complete it. \nCasillas stated from November 2013 to June 30, 2014, he submitted DARs with mistakes \non them. Casillas said the mistakes were not intentional and were just sloppy \nrecordkeeping. Casillas stated to his knowledge, during that time period, he did not \nsubmit any overtime slips or DARs for times that he did not work. Casillas stated \nduring that time period nothing stood out where he was overpaid or paid for overtime \nhe did not work and he notified the City of Calexico of the discrepancy. \nCasillas said in order to conduct a thorough investigation the whole Department should \nbe interviewed, whoever filled out overtime slips for Stone Garden. \nVI. \nFINDINGS \nThe findings of this Confidential Investigative Report do not reach questions of law as to \nwhether the alleged misconduct supports a violation of applicable laws, but instead \naddress whether the employer's policies were violated. \n-52-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luis CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nSee Section V ® Investigation for the 44 allegations against Officer Luis Casillas. \nI find Allegations 1-44 to be Sustained. \nDiscussion \nBecause of the large number of allegations, each and every allegation will not be \ndiscussed individually. Specific information organized in the investigation by each DAR \nsubmission date is included in Section V, the investigation section of the report. That \ninformation along with the corresponding spreadsheet (Addenda 7A-F) was used to \norganize the documented evidence and to support the findings. For this discussion, \ncategories of conduct that Casillas engaged in that supported the findings will be \nexplained. \nAllegations 1-8 represent incidents where Casillas failed to clock in and/or clock out. \nBy policy and practice, officers are required to clock in and clock out using a time stamp \nlocated outside of Administration. If the officer is unable to do so, they are required to \nannotate their time card with the actual time and ensure it is reviewed and initialed by \na supervisor. \nAllegations 9-10 represent incidents where Casillas submitted overtime slips for time \nhis time card did not support. On these occasions, I noted that Casillas clocked in late or \nout early and the calculated time of overtime actually documented based on the time \nstamps was approximately 30 minutes less than the hours for which Casillas submitted \nand was paid for overtime. \nAllegations 11-21 represent incidents where Casillas submitted documents for \novertime that was in violation of federal Stone Garden overtime guidelines. The Stone \nGarden guidelines were clarified in two emails on October 15, 2013 and July 10, 2014 \nfrom the OPSG Program Manager Bryan Kastoll to OPSG agencies including the Calexico \nPolice Department (Addenda 8A-B). \nOne type of submission for Casillas that violated the guidelines was where he submitted \novertime for a date when there was no operation plan. This conduct was most obvious \nin May 2014 when there were no Stone Garden operation plans for the entire month of \nMay 2014 and Casillas worked two shifts totaling 18 hours. \nAnother type of submission was where Casillas would work a date where there was an \noperation plan but, his hours were not entirely consistent with the posted details. In \nsome cases the shift he worked was not at all during the detail hours and in other cases \nhe worked hours that were part of an operation plan but he also worked additional \nhours before or after that were not consistent with the details. \n-53-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER Luis CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nIn other cases, Casillas submitted overtime on a date that a Stone Garden detail was \nscheduled, but his narrative and/or his activity was not included in the Stone Garden \noperation plan or area.Yet in other cases, there was a combination of the three above \nviolations of guidelines. \nAllegations 2242 represent incidents where the data demonstrated that it was more \nlikely than not that Casillas falsified his DARs. I considered the possibility that the \ninaccuracies on the DAR's were mistakes or just poor record-keeping as Casillas stated \nin his interview. I found that it was more likely than not that an error in including the \ndates on two DARs, December 5 and December 6 were mistakes. However, during my \ndocument analysis, I uncovered considerable inconsistent data regarding DAR vehicle \nodometer readings compared to the mileage logs and other employee Stone Garden \nDARs. Moreover, there were at least a few occasions when another officer noted either \nvia the mileage log or a DAR that they were driving the same vehicle at the same time \nthat Casillas was driving it. On those occasions, I also noted that the mileage that \nCasillas noted was considerably different than the progression of the odometer \nreadings for that vehicle. Therefore, I determined that more likely than not, the falsified \nvehicle reading was Casillas'. Also, I noted on several occasions when Casillas' \nodometer readings did not calculate out to the miles Casillas noted on his DAR. \nFurthermore, there were three separate series of odometer readings where the \nreadings were exactly the same, clearly showing inaccuracy and based on the totality of \nthe circumstances, more likely than not falsified readings and vehicles. \nMoreover, there were several occasions when I noted follow-on odometer readings \nfrom DAR to DAR where the odometer readings were clearly inaccurate but, more \nimportantly they were intentionally falsified. The very act of starting an odometer \nreading from the last ending odometer reading of a previous DAR, sometimes several \ndays prior, shows clear intent to document that odometer reading and eliminates any \npossibility of a mistake or the simple reuse of the template. \nAdditionally there were two occasions when Casillas did not note any odometer \nreadings or mileage. In one of those cases, Casillas was working with Duran and \nsubmitted no DAR. In that case, I noted that Duran's DAR included that he was driving a \nblack Chevy Tahoe and his noted odometer reading was the exact same reading as \nDuran's previous odometer reading in the same vehicle during the prior shift. I fully \ndocumented the analysis in the investigation. These inconsistent readings occurred \nwith each vehicle Casillas drove and for each and every Stone Garden shift he worked. \nOne of the vehicles involved in this inconsistent data was Unit #570 which has an \napparently intermittently readable digital odometer. I considered the possibility of \nmistaken or careless odometer readings or the intermittent illegible nature of Unit \n#570's odometer. However, because Casillas' readings were inconsistent with the \nregular progression of the odometer of that vehicle when it was readable and in some \ncases, inconsistent with his own readings, I find that it is more likely than not that \n- 54 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CAsILLAs \nCONFIDENTIAL \nCasillas intentionally falsified his DAR odometer readings and mileage to support his \novertime submission and to deceive reviewers of his DARs. \nAllegations 22-42 may also represent incidents where Casillas noted on his DAR that he \ncompleted certain activity that could not be confirmed by any data source including the \nSpillman CAD/RMS system. Some of those incidents Casillas indicated were that he \nwrote a number of citations but, a review of the Spillman system and citation query \nfound his actual numbers were less than his DAR notation. \nAllegations 22-42 may also include incidents where Casillas submitted DARs with \ninaccurate information. Sometimes the inaccurate information appeared to be the \nresult of re-using the same template without ensuring the form that he had completed \nincluded accurate information. One such example occurred on June 13, 2014 when \nCasillas showed driving a brown Fusion but left the same mileage and odometer \nreadings as the prior two Stone Garden Shifts on May 12 and May 30, 2014. However, \nmistake or the simple resuse of a template is ruled out when the reader reviews the \nremainder of the DARs when Casillas purposefully changed the date in the narrative to \nthe appropriate date on the DAR. \nBased on Casillas' time cards, he received compensation for the overtime. Per the \nFinance Director John Quinn and based on his own statements, Casillas never returned \nany overpayment to the City and never reported overpayment on his paycheck \n(Investigator's Note 2). Therefore, Casillas accepted the compensation. \nAllegation 43 is the result of Casillas consistently and without modification indicating \nthat there was no intent to any of the inaccurate DAR entries. Casillas was shown \nnumerous examples of how the entry could not have been a mistake or the simple reuse \nof the template and Casillas consistently denied that there was intent to falsify or \ninclude false or inaccurate data. He firmly held to the position that any inconsistent \ndata on the DAR was the result of a \"mistake,\" poor recordkeeping or the reuse of a \ntemplate. However, the evidence showed that intent was demonstrated particularly as \nit related to the falsification of the odometer readings, most notably from December 14, \n2013 through December 17, 2013, where the evidence showed that Casillas had to \nintentionally begin the starting odometer reading at the last one he noted on his DAR \nand then add an ending reading and then calculate that mileage and include it (or vice \nversa). \nMoreover, where Casillas failed to include vehicle information on his DAR, such as that \non December 5, 2013 (Addendum 13E), mistake is ruled out and intent was \ndemonstrated by Casillas placing lines in the box where the information should have \nbeen included. Therefore, Casillas' falsification of the documents was demonstrated by \nomissions as well as false information thus, demonstrating an intent to deceive rather \nthan just laziness, sloppiness, poor record keeping, mistakes or the simple reuse of the \n-55-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATWE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \ntemplate. Based on the evidence, these are clear indications of false information \nbecause, in part, there is no way that the odometer readings Casillas included were \ncorrect based on the other evidence. Therefore, Casillas' continuing denial that he did \nnot intend to include the information on the DAR and it was either a mistake or the \nresult of reusing the template is a continual false and misleading statement. \nFinally, a review of the 21 DARs and the documented evidence for the allegations that \ninclude evidence of a lack of activity during many of his Stone Garden details, along with \nwitness statements and Casillas° interview, support an additional allegation for a \npattern of conduct that is consistent with overtime abuse and misuse. Therefore, based \non the totality of the circumstances and a preponderance of evidence, I find that all 44 \nallegations against Officer Luis Casillas are sustained. \n- 56 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE; STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nWITNESS LIST \nName \nDate & Time \nDigital Record No. Page \nAlarcon, Rudy \n7/16/14 12:17 p.m. \n140716-003 \n45 \nPolice Officer (Formerly Sergeant) \nCalexico Police Department \nBielma, Joe \n12/17/13 12:17 p.m. \n131217-002 \n31 \nFormer Police Commissioner \nCity of Calexico \nCasillas, Luis \n1/29/15 9:50 a.m. \n150129-002 \n44 \nPolice Officer \nCalexico Police Department \nCeja, Manuel \n6/4/14 10:00 a.m. \n140604-002 \n32 \nPolice Officer \nCalexico Police Department \nGerardo, Gonzalo \n1/16/14 12:00 noon \n140116-003 \n32 \nLieutenant \n7/30/14 5:10 p.m. \n141203-002 \nCalexico Police Department \nGomez, Martha \n1/16/14 10:15 a.m. \n140116-005 \n34 \nExecutive Assistant \n7/31/14 12:26 p.m. \n140731-003 \nCalexico Police Department \nLegaspi, Victor \n7/31/14 5:14 p.m. \n140731-005 \n33 \nSergeant \nCalexico Police Department \nLeon, Carmen \n11/20/14 5:05 p.m. \n141120-003 \n38 \nPublic Safety Dispatch Supervisor \nCity of Calexico \nMiramon, Leopoldo \n11/20/14 5:55 p.m. \n141120-004 \n36 \nPublic Safety Dispatcher \nCity of Calexico \nSerrano, Jesus \n1/16/14 1:45 p.m. \n140116-004 \n35 \nLieutenant \n7/31/14 9:02 a.m. \n140731-002 \nCalexico Police Department \n-57-\nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nTabarez, Pompey() \n7/8/14 10:02 a.m. \n140708-002 \n39 \nFormer Chief of Police \nCalexico Police Department \nUriarte, Frank \n7/16/14 2:57 p.m. \n140716-004 \n41 \nSergeant \n12/3/14 3:45 p.m. \n141203-003 \nCalexico Police Department \n- 58 - \nCALEXICO POLICE DEPARTMENT \nINVESTIGATIVE REPORT \nRE: STONE GARDEN OVERTIME BY POLICE OFFICER LUIS CASILLAS \nCONFIDENTIAL \nINVESTIGATOR'S NOTES \n1. According to Martha Gomez, no mileage entries were located in the mileage log \nbook for December 2013 for dates from June 4 through June 14, 2014 (Addenda \n26HHH & 26111). Only one entry was located for June 4, 2014 and four entries were \nlocated for June 14, 2014. The dates in between were missing in the log book. \n2. \nAccording to Calexico Finance Director John Quinn, and since Quinn began as the \nFinance Director over two years prior, Casillas has never reported overpayment on \nhis check or attempted to return funds received on his paycheck to the City. \n3. \nI reviewed the 2010-2012 MOU Extension between the City of Calexico and the \nCalexico Police Officer's Association and the unsigned 2012-2013 MOU between the \nCity of Calexico and the Calexico Police Officer's Association. I found no reference \nto \"flex time\" which Uriarte stated allowed 14 minutes of flex time when working \novertime; anything over 15 minutes gets rounded to 30 minutes, and anything past \n45 minutes gets rounded to one hour. However, Calexico Police Department Policy \n1038.3.1, provides for accounting for portions of an hour. \n4. \nGomez advised that even if one or more officers are working together, each \novertime slip submitted by each officer, must have a separate back-up DAR along \nwith the overtime slip. Per M. Gomez, no DAR for June 20, 2014 was submitted for \nthe four hours of Stone Garden Overtime for which Casillas received overtime \ncompensation. Therefore, his hours were not included in the billing summary and \nthe City was not reimbursed for his time by the federal grant. \n5. \nA review of COBAN (In-Car Video) records was conducted for the 21 dates that \nCasillas worked Stone Garden overtime. The searched returned COBAN records for \nonly one date. On January 15, 2014, a date when Casillas showed working with \nNavarro, the records showed that the system in Unit #527 started up at 7:37 a.m. \nThe officer I.D. was 1111 which is the training I.D. Over the following hours until \n14:31 p.m. there were a series of 24 entries indicating numerous shutdowns due to \nlow power and system start ups. There were no recordings or any other activity \nthat could be evaluated. Thus, the data was not included in the investigation and \nnot considered in the analysis. \nInvestigated by Betty P.

Also \npresent is: \nOTHER SPEAKER: Attorney Kristopher Di Giovanni with \nAdams Ferrone. It's Kristopher, K-R-I-S-T-O-P-H-E-R, \nDi Giovanni, D-I, space, capital G-I-O-V-A-N-N-I. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd also present is: \nOther Speaker: Lieutenant Jesus Serrano, last name \nspelled S-E-R-R-A-N-0. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd, uh, Di Giovanni is Casillas' \nemployee representative. Let it be noted they are also \nrecording, um, as well as I am. Uh, Officer Casillas, I \nhave been retained to conduct a confidential \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ninvestigation concerning complaints that have been filed \nwith the City of Calexico and to which you have been \nidentified as a subject employee. The investigation \ninvolves allegations of misuse of city resources since \nChief Tabarez was hired as the Chief of Calexico Police \nDepartment. My role as an investigator is a neutral fact \nfinder. I am not acting as an advocate for the persons \nwho filed the complaint or the person or agency \nresponding to the complaint nor am I an advocate for the \nCity of Calexico. As part of my investigation, I will \ntake statements from relevant parties and collect and \nreview documents and any other relevant evidence. I will \nreview the information you give me today and along with \nstatements from other witnesses and evidence I collect, I \nwill then report my findings to the City of Calexico. Do \nyou understand what I have explained so far? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOn, uh, Thursday, July 17, 2014, \nyou were previously interviewed regarding some of what we \nwill cover today and that is the issues of overtime \nand overtime. We very, very basically covered that \nI interviewed you last time, but did you offer them \nuse \nwhen \nan \nopportunity to have their interview? I know you recorded \nit last time. \nOTHER SPEAKER: \nYes ****. \n3 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nBut they knew, they already had \nit, so, so it's really not that much we're going into \ndepth a lot more this time. This interview will continue \non from that point and also may cover other incidents \nreported since that date. On January 13, 2015, you were \nserved with a memo by Lieutenant Jesus Serrano directing \nyou to be present for this interview. Oh, this one's \nfrom Michael J. Bostic, interim chief of police. I'm \nholding in my hand a document dated January 13, 2014, but \nthat is a mistake because it was 2015, am I correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes, you are. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, I just noticed that, and \nit's signed by Michael J. Bostic, interim chief of police \ndated 1/13/2015. I'm gonna hand that over to you. Do \nyou recognize this document? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes, I do. It's the same one that \nI have. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, and did you have an \nopportunity to read that document? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes, I did. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, so, um, you know that in \nthis memo you were ordered to cooperate fully with the \ninvestigation and to answer all of our questions, my \nquestions, in a complete and truthful manner. You are \nalso ordered to obey any lawful directive I give. Also \n4 \n1 \n2 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nin the memo you were ordered to refrain from discussing \nor communicating in any way the issues in \ninvestigation, the questions asked and/or \nnotice, the administrative interview, and \nthis \nanswered this \nthe allegations \nwith anyone other than your attorney or authorized \nrepresentative. The prohibition applies to communication \nwith employees of the city, members of the elected or \nappointed bodies of the city or anyone who could \npotentially be a witness in this investigation including \nformer employees. That prohibition remains until such \ntime this investigation is completed and you are formally \nnotified by the city that you are no longer subject to \nthe order. Do you understand the order as given by \nLieutenant Serrano and Chief Bostic? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes, I do. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo you are reminded not to engage \nin any retaliatory actions or behavior towards \ncomplainants, witnesses or potential witnesses and any \nviolations of the above orders will be considered an act \nof insubordination and can be an independent basis for \ndisciplinary action up to and including termination. Do \nyou understand this? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes, I do. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nBefore we go to the Lybarger \nadmonishment, um, Mr. Di Giovanni did you want to make \n5 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nany comments or anything, concerns? \nOther Speaker: \nUh, yes. I just wanted to know \nfor the record that, um, we're objecting to the notice \nthat was served on January 13, 2015 to my client as \ninadequate notice not providing any information based on, \num, just a listing of misuse of Department resources. \nThe allegations, this is, um, not giving my client the \nability to properly prepare for this interview and also, \nuh, afforded him adequate legal representation due to the \ndeficiency of the notice. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nThank you, and of course, uh, the \nposition I have on that is that I believe it was adequate \nnotice because misuse of Department resources overtime \nuse is a misuse of Department resources if it's abused. \nSo, we're gonna go forward. Lieutenant Serrano, would \nyou please conduct the Lybarger? \nOTHER SPEAKER: \nDue to the nature of this \nadministrative investigation Governor Code § 3303H \nrequires me to advise you of your Constitutional rights. \nTherefore, it is important that you understand that \ncriminally you have the right to remain silent. Anything \nyou say may be used against you in court. You have the \nright to an attorney before and during any questioning. \nDo you understand each of these rights that I have \nexplained to you? \n6 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \nOTHER SPEAKER: \nWith these rights in mind, do you \nwant to talk, will you talk to us now? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo. \nOTHER SPEAKER: \nOkay, I've annotated your \nresponses in note form and at the end you will have a \nchance to initial them. While you have the right to \nremain silent with regards to any criminal investigation, \nyou do not have the right to refuse to answer my \nquestions or our questions ****. \nThis is an \nadministrative investigation, I am therefore now ordering \nyou to answer all our questions fully and honestly. If \nyou refuse to answer our questions, your silence can be \ndeemed insubordination and result in administrative \ndiscipline up to and including termination. Any \nstatement you make under compulsion of the threat of such \ndiscipline is for administrative purposes only and cannot \nbe used against you in a criminal proceeding. Do you \nunderstand this admonishment? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \nOTHER SPEAKER: \nWill you talk to us now? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \nOTHER SPEAKER: \nOkay. I've annotated your \nresponse in the form and please initial every one of \nthose and then sign and date. \n7 \n1 \n3 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nToday is the - \nOTHER SPEAKER: \n29t11, fifteen. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nYeah, still doing that. \nOTHER SPEAKER: \nSign this. Okay. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, thank you very much. \nOTHER SPEAKER: \nAll right, I'm going to be \nexcusing myself. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nYou are excused. Thank you. \nOkay, so, um, I'm gonna go into the questions now. \nBefore I continue on do you have any questions or \nconcerns? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm, no. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, anything more to say? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Are you ill, injured or \nunder the influence of any medication that will affect \nyour answers or ability to be interviewed here today? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nIs there any reason you will not \nbe able to fully participate in this interview and \ninvestigation? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, do you understand why you \nare here and your responsibility to cooperate? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \n8 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nIf you don't understand a \nquestion, because I admit fully that sometimes I make bad \nquestions, please let me know, I'll repeat or clarify. \nPlease do not answer a question you do not understand. I \nhave a habit of kind of doing two or three questions in a \nquestion. If you need me to break it down I will do \nthat. Okay? Um, if you need a break, let me know, we \ncan do that. Uh, she brought some water in. If you need \nsome additional water, I'm going to walk over there and \nget some myself. I forgot to do that, and, um, of course \nif you make it through to your water you're welcome to \ntake that. Okay, so, I've gotten your background on a \nprevious interview. What I'd really like you to do is \njust remind me the date you came on, how long you've been \non the job, you know, what any promotions you have and \nthe rank that you were at, um, and if you have not been \non the job for a period of time why would that ****. \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nOkay. Would you like me to start \nfrom the beginning of, uh, my, uh, date of hire with \nCalexico or my police record? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nDate of hire with Calexico 'cause \nI believe we have the rest of this. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nOkay. I believe - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nFrom your prior interview. Yeah. \n9 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI believe, uh, I got hired in \n2008, August 2008, and, uh, I've been on patrol ever \nsince up into, up until 2014, uh, sometime in, um, I want \nto say, uh, June when I got promoted to, uh, the \nDetective Bureau. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, June 2014 somewhere around \nthere you were -\nLUIS CASILLAS: \nSomewhere -® \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nI can probably track that, all \nright. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, um, promoted to Detective \nBureau, and is that a promotion or is that a, an \nassignment with some benefits? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, it's, it's, it's a \npromotion. You do have a, you do get a five percent, uh \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nuh, pay, special pay increase \nand, well, I don't know if you want to call it a \npromotion or not. It all depends on how you look at it, \nI guess. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nYeah, I think one is like \npermanent and the other one is a pay increase and it's a \nspecial assignment - \n10 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- with, with benefits, but having \nworked personnel - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- in the past that's just where my \nbrain goes. So, um, and what did you do when you were \nworking investigations? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell I started off, uh, working \nalongside of, uh, Detective Rodriguez and, uh, Sergeant, \nuh, Hermando ****, and the, uh, Detective Bureau, and, \nyou know, started from the, the ground up. I, prior to \nthat I had, I've only been up, you know, had only did \npatrol assignments, uh, most of my career, and so just \nthe fundamentals of, you know, basic detective work and, \nuh, through the period that I was there they, they, the, \nthey had the opportunity to send me to basic, uh, uh, \ndetective school, uh, for about a week and, uh, that I \nattended out in Carlsbad at Carlsbad, uh, Police \nDepartment, and, uh, that was pretty much it. After that \nwe typically just, we really didn't have, we weren't \nassigned a specific, um, we, we didn't break the, the \ncases down by, by, uh, by crimes or anything. It was \nkinda like just, uh, the, the, you know, priority cases, \nif something came up or, uh, we basically just worked on \nmainly child abuse cases. \n11 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, we just didn't have the \nresources to do anything else. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, and so, um, at some time \nafter that did you go off duty? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes, and then in October, uh, \nsometime in October, October the 30th, I believe were \nplaced on administrative leave and I've been off ever \nsince. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, and during that time, during \nall this patrol time and your investigative period time, \ndid, were you ever, um, acting as an officer in charge or \nsitting in as a sergeant or anything like that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, there was a few occasions when \nI did, but, uh, because of the sit-, the way that it \nworked here was at least, uh, uh, seniority, whoever had \nseniority on the team was the, the OTC or the Officer in \nCharge. Um, so because I was at the bottom of the, of \nthe seniority list, even though I had more years of \nexperience than other officers, um, most of the time I \nwasn't the guy in charge, even though I had a little more \nexperience, just because of the fact that, you know, they \nkinda did it based on seniority, so. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nCalexico Police Department \nseniority. \n12 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nCalexico, yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo since you came on in 2008 - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nRight. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- you were kinda like - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nAt the bottom of the totem pole. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- didn't have a lot of seniority. \nOkay, I understand that. So, since your, um, let's just \ntalk a little bit about take-home cars. Did you have a \ntake-home car while you were an investigator? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes, I did. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, and do you know what the \nunit number was of this take-home car? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo, um, I identified it as the \ngray Fusion. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nA gray Fusion, okay, and prior to \ngoing to investigations, uh, did you use black and whites \nor undercover cars? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nBlack and whites. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, and do you recall what black \nand white you predominantly used, or did you have one? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, no, I don't recall. I mean, \nuh, they did assign us a unit, and, uh, it was based on, \nagain, seniority or if you're on the shift, if you're on \nthe shift and that was your permanent shift you went to \nyour car, but if your car broke down or your car was \n13 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nbeing serviced, you would take a spare car which would \nbe, you know, as we called the old collar cars, the Crown \nVics, and, uh, that's, that's kind of what you drove. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, and so you were assigned a \nvehicle. You used it most of the time unless - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMost of the time. \n- there was some - \n****. \n- \n* * * * \nnot. Okay. I understand \nthat. So, having said that, uh, what if you were there \non overtime and another \nassigned to that car or \npeople assigned to that \nsuper-, were you the only one \nwas there one, more than one \nunit? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, typically there was someone \nelse that shared that, that new car, what we called the \nnew car, and, uh, typically it was the opposite shift, so \nyou wouldn't, you know, bump, bump into each other at the \nend of, end of watch. So, um, it was, it was prob-, it \nwas typically someone that worked the opposite days of \nyou so that the car would rest and so, you know, no one, \nthe car would, would, you know, wouldn't be idle, you \nknow, 24-7, but that, that wasn't always the case. Um, \nour fleet, we had a lot of issues with the Chargers and, \nyou know, they're constantly in and out of the shop, so, \nyou know, and they're really, they had a system but it \n14 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ndidn't always work. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nDo you recall what the issues were \nwith the Chargers? I mean, what was wrong with them? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, right out of the chute some \nof the, the first issues were the, uh, the brakes. They \nwere having a lot \njust some type of \nproperly to where \nof brake issues. Um, apparently it was \ndefect or, or they, they weren't built \nthe, uh, ball joints in the front and \nthe brakes would go, go out about every 3,000 miles. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nWow. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nSo, uh, they were constantly - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nThat's scary. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- in the shop. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, anything else that you can \nrecall? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, they had a lot of issues with \nthe computers, with the computer system. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, sometimes the Code 3 lights \ndidn't work because it was all intertwined with the, with \nthe system. Shock and release wouldn't work so they, \nthey had a lot of, lot of glitches in the system so they \nweren't out. We never had the, the, the fleet \n100 percent ****. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, um, if you were working \n15 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \na \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nan overtime shift and someone else was there you would \ntake a different car - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n® is that what I'm hearing? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. I'd take a different car, \nwhatever was available. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, um, given that, could \nyou just go through what your day would be like when you \ncame on duty as a police officer? You know, what's the \nfirst thing you do, the second thing you do, the third \nthing you do, and just give me a chronological of that. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, you know, after, after roll \ncall, uh, we were typically assigned, uh, our beats. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nActually could you start before \nthat when you walked in the back door? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, when you walk in the back \ndoor, you, you know, you shoot the shit with **** the \nparking lot. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nJust prior to getting to the \nlocker room and, uh, kinda * * * * \nit all depends. If \nyou're, uh, a last-minute guy or if you're a guy that \ncomes in 10, 15 minutes prior. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nWhat are you? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, I'm in between. \n16 \n1 \n3 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nSometimes I'm a last-minute guy, \nsometimes I'm a 10-minute guy. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd do you come in in uniform or \ndo you go to the locker room and dress? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo, I go to the locker room and \ndress. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Some people come in \nuniform, some\nLUIS CASILLAS: \nSome people do come in unifo \nat \nleast with their, with their shirts and they just go to \nthe locker room and put on their boots, I mean their sand \nbrowns and stuff like that, but I typically did always, I \nnever came in uniform. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, continue on. So, now \nyou've come in the back door and you've shot the shit, \nyou've gone into the locker room. You're starting to\nLUIS CASILLAS: \nclock in. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nUh, when you remember you would \nOkay. If you remember clock in. \nWhy would there be a reason you wouldn't remember? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, you get sidetracked. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYou get sidetracked and sometimes \nyou forget to clock in. \n17 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo you try to clock in before you \ngo into the locker room? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI, I would, I would try to clock \nin before I went to the locker room, but once again I, \nthat wasn't always the case. Sometimes you get side \ntracked and all. it takes is for someone, you know, tap \nyou on the shoulder and, you know, you lose focus and \nbefore you know it, you know \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nyeah. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n® you, you don't clock in. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, so let's go on. So, now \nyou've either clocked in before or when you come out \nyou're going to briefing or clocking in and what? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, then you, you go through the \ntypical roll call. They go through the logs. Uh, either \nthe sergeant or the officer in charge goes through the \nlogs. We share information with the previous shift. Uh, \nwe have a, uh, some type of roll call training, but most \nof the time they went over the, the **** the policy \nbook, unless there were some there was a hot call that \nwas pending or something that was going on then, then, \nyou know, we would just hit the field, but, uh, most, \nmost of the time they, they read some type of policy. \nUm, you'd get assigned your, your beats and you'd go out \nto your beat. Depending on what beat you had in the \n18 \n1 \n2 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ncity, it's broken up into, into quadrants of, uh, and \nthere's four of them, and you, you know, you go, you go \nto your area and you shag the calls from your, from your \nbeat. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo let's back up a little bit from \nthere. When you get in your car, I mean, do you check \nout\nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell\nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- **** then or how does that all \nwork? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, when you, typically there's, \nthe shotgun situation, um, some cars have shotguns in \nthere, some didn't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, so at times it was a hit and \nmiss. You know, some guys carry their rifles, some guys \ndidn't. Um, and the reason for that is, uh, you know, \nsome of the racks, uh, you know, some of the racks aren't \nreally properly, uh, made or adjusted to our, to our \nrifles and, uh, there was a lot of issues with the racks \nand, you know, they, as time went on they kind of fixed \nthem, but it was, it didn't always work. So, some cars \nhad shotguns, some didn't, um, and, uh, typically there, \nif there was a shotgun in there before you go 10-8, you \nknow, you kinda run through your car, you know, take out \n19 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nyour shotgun make sure that it's, that it's, uh, that \nit's, uh, you empty it out and then reload it and kinda \ngo through your own personal checklist, uh, and, uh, you \nknow, for awhile there we had, uh, we actually had, uh, \nuh, sheets, uh, that we would check off for fuel and gas \nand like everything else it only worked for, for, for \nawhile and then after that it just kind of you grab the \nsheet and then the sheets were never around and before \nyou know it we're not using sheets anymore, kinda back to \nall of that. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. Mm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, you kinda check out your unit, \nyour weapons and you go 10-8. Some guys like to take \ntheir, their rifle, long rifles out, some guys didn't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nUh huh. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, you know, I, I, I would take \nit out sometimes and sometimes I didn't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, and, uh, sometimes you - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo you were all assigned a long \nrifle, is that correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWe were all assigned a long rifle. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nEvery patrol officer is assigned a \nlong rifle? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nEvery patrol officer. \n20 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n6 \n7 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nOkay, and that's your own personal \nrifle and some guys take them home, some guys leave them \nin the locker and that's kinda the way it works. Um, \ntypically what you're supposed to, as you take, leave \nthe, the, the rear lot you're supposed to, um, you know, \ncall in the unit number and your mileage and, uh, let the \ndispatch or the dispatchers know what, what, what's your \nassigned, what's your assigned beat. Um, it didn't \nalways work, it didn't always happen, you know, sometimes \nyou forget, sometimes, uh, you did it, sometimes you \ndidn't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo you're saying you, sometimes \nyou didn't do it? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOther people didn't as well, but \nyou didn't do it sometimes. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIt's, it was hit and miss. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nWhy is that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, uh, just bad habits that, \nthat, that you don't get rid of that you start picking up \nas, as, uh, you know, I don't know, just human nature. \nSometimes you've got bad habits you just can't shake off \nand, and, uh, it's just a lot of reasons. I don't know, \nbut you know, you try, but it doesn't always happen. \n21 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, it, and to follow up on that, \nif you were to say what percentage of the time that you \nwent out in the field and you did that and, or the \npercentage that you didn't, what percentage might that \nbe? And this is just an estimate, I realize that. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIf I had to take a, if I had to \nguess I would guess 50 percent of the time. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Okay. Okay, could you, um, \ngive me a feeling of you get out in your car and you're \nnow leaving the station and you're giving them your \nmileage and your car and your beat. Is that correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nThat's correct. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nWhat do you do with the, there, \nare there MDCs in the car or MDTs? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes, yes, there is, um - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, and are they used to log on \nor do you use them to log on or tell me how that happens. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nThe, uh, MDTs, uh, sometimes work \nand sometimes didn't. Um, if you were, if you were in \none of the newer cars, uh, most of the time they, they \ndidn't work, um, and same with the, with the older cars, \nbut the older cars tend to work a little more than the \nnewer cars for whatever reason. I, I don't know but, uh, \nso the, the older cars had more, this Motorola system \nwhich - \n22 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- you, you have to log in and you \nhave to put in your password -\nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- and so on and so forth, and the \nsame thing with the, the Dodge Chargers, but, um, they \ndidn't always work, the system wasn't always up to par. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, uh, did you do it, I mean, did \nyou try every time or did you just\nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIt, you, you try. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- say this doesn't work. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo, you try and after a few times \nyou, you give up. Um, and sometimes, you know, if you \nhit a dead spot or if it kicks you off or whatever the \nsituation may be, you know, you kind of get tired of \nputting in a password, you know, and um, sometimes we \nused them, sometimes we didn't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, so tell me a little bit \nabout other systems in the car, um, like the, do you have \nan in-car video in them? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, yeah. There is a, a, the new \ncars had a charade of electronics. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, I'm not a big electronic guy \nbut I know that, uh, some of the cameras worked, some of \n23 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthem didn't. Uh, I know that there's audio in the back, \nsome worked, some didn't. Um, uh, I wouldn't know how \nto, you know, some guys are more techie than other guys. \nSome guys, you know, like to get that computer up and \ngoing before they went 10-8 and, you know, they were a \nlittle more techie with it. Some guys like me, I'm not, \nI'm not a techie guy. I don't, I don't know much about \ncomputers and I just, if it worked it worked, if it \ndidn't work, well, it just didn't work. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nThat's funny. How do you know if \nit's working? Is there a process to turn it on or turn \nit off - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- how does that work? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, I, I really don't, don't \nremember the process for the uh, \nChargers, but it, the screen was \nbut, um, you know, typically you \nfor the, for the \nthe same as the old cars \nhave a password, a login \nand a password, um, and, uh, first initial and last name \nand then your password was typically the first three \nletters of your last name and the, and the last four, uh, \nnumbers of your Social Security, and, uh, that's, you \nknow, like I said, sometimes it worked, sometimes it \ndidn't. Um, some guys, some guys were real techie, like \nI said, and they would just sit there and mess with it \n24 \n1 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nall day until they got it to work. Some guys didn't, um. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, did you ever use it? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI, I used it at times. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd did you log on with your first \nname and last name like you told me, the initials and all \nthat kind of stuff? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nTypically, yeah. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd when you did that, um, do you \nknow what the system boot up process is and when it's \nactivated and when it starts recording and all of that \nstuff? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, as far as the new cars? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nUm, I, I don't know, if it's \ndifferent tell, tell - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo, I, yeah, the, the, the old \ncars, the, the old car was a little more, it's a little \nmore simple. You log on, the way that you know that it's \nworking typically it'll show you on the screen and it'll \nshow the other cars, it'll show the address or the \nlocation of the other cars where they're at, and you can \ngo into the call and see what the nature of the call is. \nSo, you know if you're on just by looking at, at the \nscreen. The, the new cars would do the same, but like I \nsaid, I don't know if, I don't know how all that stuff \nworked as far as, uh, the recorders or, you know, I know, \n25 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nuh, you know, some guys, you had to do something in the \nback sometimes. You gotta, had to reboot it and they \njust had a lot of issues with those cars. If they left \nthem, if they turned off the key the whole car would shut \ndown. They had to get a jump so a lot of guys would \nleave the cars on. It, it just, it became kind of a mess \nafter awhile and, um, you know, after awhile, I worked on \nthe, with the new cars a very short time because when I \ngot back from, uh, when I got back from my workers' comp, \num, you know, I had a, I only came, I came back like for \nfour, five months and then I was put in the, uh, and \npromoted to the Detective Bureau, so I, I really didn't \nget a, a whole lot of time with the, with the new cars, \nbut, uh, I know that they're, they were supposed to do a \nbunch of Wazoo stuff. I don't know if it actually worked \nor not or how that stuff worked. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd, and do you know what the \ntriggers are for the recordings. Do you, were you ever \ntrained in any of that - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm mmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- do you recall or anything like \nthat? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nuh, no. For any, anytime we \nneeded a recording of, of any footage from the vehicle \nyou had to go through uh, uh, uh, Steven Frazier who was \n26 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthe computer guy or the lieutenant, Lieutenant Geraldo \nwho were the, you know, the computer liaisons or whatever \nthey did. I don't know how that you would turn it off or \non or if any of that stuff actually ever worked. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay, okay, fair enough. So, um, \nhave you ever reviewed any of the video that ever came \nfrom you? You said you'd have to go to them to look at \nit. Have you ever looked at any of your videos or any \nvideo that comes out of the **** system? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, not that I recall. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Do you know if any of your \ncontacts or any of your time in patrol resulted in a \nvideo being created? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, there's a possibility. I, I \ndon't know if any of these cars\nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n® if the car that I was driving \nworked or not. I know that they had some, some sort of \ndeal where, you know, once you hit the Code 3 lights it \nrecords a minute or a couple seconds prior and after or \nif you're, you know, some, you know, some people said \nthere was, you know, if you're outside talking to your \npartner, you know, it had mics. I, I don't know if, uh, \nI mean, I don't know if, if any of that stuff really \nworked or, or if I ever was recorded on them. I'm sure I \n27 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwas if it worked. I don't know, I was around the, the \nvehicle so I'm sure at one point I was recorded. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, um, so do you know if \nyou don't log onto the system whether there's like a \ndefault logon process that occurs whether you like it or \nnot? I mean, if you get in a car and\nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- turn it on do you know if \nthere's some sort of way that it boots up on its own, \neven if you don't put in your password to log in? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, no. I, I don't know what \nthere is. I. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, if I were to go into \nthe COBAN system, which is your in-car video system, and \npull video for the dates and times that you were working \nand it indicated that you were in a certain vehicle on \nyour logs, let's say, but I look at the video and it's \nnot you. Can you explain how that might have occurred? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Have you used another \nofficer's logon information to log in to COBAN or to the \nin-car video system? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm, I don't recall. I might have. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd under what circumstances, \ncircumstances might you log on to the COBAN system? \n28 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nTo the. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nWith another person's. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, maybe if my password didn't \nwork or. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd, and do you specifically \nrecall ® and I think you answered this, but I'm gonna ask \nit again ® do you re, specifically recall ever doing \nthat? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, I don't recall ever doin' \nthat. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd, um, I have these, that answer \nso hang on for a second. Is there any other reason you \nmight use someone else's, uh, login information? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, other than, uh, you know, \nmaybe my, my password didn't work or I mean that's the \nonly thing that I can think of. I don't recall every, \never, uh, doing it but it could be a possibility where, \nwhere, where it's been done. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, let's go into overtime \na little bit. Um, can you tell me a little bit about \nyour overtime system and I'm holding in my hand an \novertime slip and if that helps you understand it better \nand to tell me how it works. Um, just go overview about. \nWhat types of overtime? When are they used? All that \nkind of stuff and your responsibility as it relates to \n29 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \novertime. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, well, in front of me is a, you \nknow, a, a overtime slip and basically, you put your name \nand your division. In this case, I would, the way that I \nfill it out is I put my initial and my last name and I, \nuh, put patrol up there and, and, uh, there's a lot of \ncheckboxes on, in this slip where there's court or you \nkind of put whatever kind of pertains to the overtime \nthat you're doin'. If you're court and you check off the \ncourt, uh, line there and then you put how many hours \nyou, you worked. If it was, uh, grant overtime, uh, \nStone Garden and you would hit the grant and overtime and \nyou put the hours and, uh, it, if it was some type of a \nDUI grant or anything like that, they typically tell you \nwhat to put on there. Uh, the sergeants or lieutenants \nsay, um, you know, DUI checkpoint or, you know, often \ntimes, uh, if you worked overtime at another city or, you \nknow, as a mutual aid they would, they would tell you \nwhat, what to put on there, um, and that's, you know, you \nput your, your assignment, uh, \nuh, the hours that you worked, \ncheck off if you want the, uh, \nthe day that you worked, \ntotal hours and then you \novertime or the comp. You \nsign it. Uh, you give it to your supervisor. He takes a \nlook at it. He signs it and, uh, you keep a copy. Uh, \nyou're, you're supposed to keep a copy of 'em but, you \n30 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nknow. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, which copy would you keep. \nI'm showing, this one has a triplicate on it. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, is it the blue copy that you \nwould keep? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah, I, I think it's the blue co, \nit says, says right, you keep the blue copy, says it \nright, says it right on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd did they ever tell you what to \nput in this, see here? Is this the payroll code, code \narea? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah. You typically check \nwhatever, whatever applies. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, if it's, uh. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nDid you ever put a number in there \nor anything like that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes, yes, yes, I'm sorry. Uh, if \nyou worked a, a grant overtime, which was Stone Garden \nand you would put 88. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, 88's the payroll code \nfor Stone Garden and that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, I, uh, I assume. I, I don't \nknow. \n31 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nYou don't know that. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI don't know but I know it, if \nit's Stone Guard, you put 88 and you circled it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay and so, when you sign your \nsignature on here saying employee signature, what are you \nsaying when you sign that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWhen you sign it, well, that you \nworked that day and those hours. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd, um, there's a little claim, \ndisclaimer up here, I certify this overtime was required \nand is accurate. Is that how you, how you perceive what, \nyour signing of it? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Can you tell me what \novertime is required and what's authorized? Tell me how \nthat decision's made. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, um, there's overtime, \nthere's a type of overtime when you're working on a re, \nlate report or a case, um, and then there's, uh, grant \novertime or some special assignment overtime if, uh, you \nknow, you're doin' a parade or there's different types of \novertimes. I, you know, it all depends what, what you \nwork is, is what you're gonna put on them. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, let's say you come into the \nstation and you have a late report. You just arrested \n32 \n1 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nbad guy. You took him to Imperial County Jail. You've \nbooked him in. Now, you gotta finish your report. How \ndo you get, how do you do that? Do you get authorization \nto do that or you just start doing it? How does that \nwork? What's the practice here? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, um, if it's a, it's a late \nreport, um, you know you advise your, whoever's in charge \nof the, of the shift hey, this is gonna put me into \novertime. You want me to stay or, or, you know, you want \nme to, to leave? So, if they authorize you to yeah, well \njust, you know, go ahead and transport him. Go ahead \nand, you know, transport him and then and then leave. \nThen what he, what he'll do is he'll sign the overtime \nslip. Um, you sign it and he sign, he signs the overtime \nslip because it happened on, on his shift. Um, every \nsergeant is different. Some sergeants won't sign the \nslip unless you worked, uh, unless you're part of his \nteam. So, the, you know, it, it all depends. It kind \nof, um, there's really no consistency on how we did it. \nYou just get a supervisor to sign your slip. Hey, I was \nhere. I stayed over 2 hours. Are you gonna sign my \nslip? Some would tell you,no. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n****. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, and some would sign it, um, \nyou know, so it, it was a, a hit and miss. \n33 \n1 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, if someone told you no, what \nwould you do? In other words, you said hey, I, I gotta \nwork overtime, go ahead and work it, um, you, will you \nsign my slip? Not until you're done with it. So, what \nwould you do about that supervisory review if they said \ngoodbye, I'm gone for the night and you just finish your \novertime? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nAnd it happened, and it happened \noften with some sergeants, like I'm not signing it, your, \nyour, your overtime. Tell your sergeant to sign it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nSo then, you know, for, if you \ndidn't want to put up a fight or anything like that, you \njust okay, well, then I'll go to my ****, see my \nsergeant tomorrow. Hey, sarge, uh, X, X sarge didn't, \ndidn't wanna sign my slip last night. Can you sign it? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, how long did you stay, an \nhour, two hours, whatever it is and he signs it and ****. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, were there ever any times that \nyou turned in your overtime slip and it wasn't signed by \na supervisor? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, it, it would have to be signed \nby a supervisor or else you're not gonna get paid. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, do you recall any time \n34 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nspecifically - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI, I don't, I don't recall. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n® that you may have turned in and \nsupe - let me finish my question ® that you may have \nturned in an overtime slip and a supervisor didn't sign \nit? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, I don't recall but I would \nassume that there could be some times. I don't know. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Can you tell me, according \nto the overtime policy, how many hours you can work in a \nday and how much time off you have to have off between, \num, working? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, I wanna say it's a total of \n16. You had to have, uh, 8 hours between a, uh, the next \nshift. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd were there any exceptions to \nthat? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, I'm sure there could be. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd do you recall any time that \nyou may have worked over the 16 hours without 8 hours \nbetween? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm, uh, I don't recall but I'm \nsure that there's, I mean there could be possibility. \nYou get into an arrest or, or something it'll and you're \nalready on your 12th hour and I mean you sure could carry \n35 \n1 \n2 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nover to the 16th or 17th hour. Doesn't always happen but \nI, I would say, venture to say that there's a possibility \nthey could. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nDo you know if there's any policy \nor procedure that requires that you limit your hours \nworked in a 3-day period or a 5-day period or a 7-day \nperiod? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, I'm sure that there is - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- but I, I, I couldn't tell you \noffhand what it, what it is. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay and have you ever had a \nsupervisor mention to you you need to go home 'cause \nyou're not within the 8-hour period of returning to work? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, I've heard supervisors tell \nother officers that. Um, me personally, typically I, you \nknow, you don't have to tell me twice to go home. I'll, \nI'll leave. I mean I, you know, I wanna do my ****. \nI'm not, you know, I don't like to mope around. I, I'm \nnot a big overtime guy so I mean I'm, I have heard, I've \nheard supervisors hey, you know, you guys gotta have \n8 hours between shifts and anything like that. Um, I \nmean I, there, there have been situations where, where I \nstayed the, you know, the 16 hours. Someone called in \nsick or just somethin' came up but, uh, not, not too \n36 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nmany. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI would have to say not too many. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay and, and is it safe to say \nthat you can't recall any specific time? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI can't recall any specific times. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Okay. Tell me a little \nbit, uh, we briefly went over your timecards. Uh, who, \nwho is responsible for the timecard submissions? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, um, the timecards are \nactually, uh, the way that payroll is done here is \nactually a train wreck and I've. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nA train wreck. Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIt really is. It's, it's \nsomethin' that we actually as a POA, uh, went over with \none of the, one, the last city manager, Mr. Oscar \nRodriguez, um, because, you know, it's just got so many, \nso many glitches and it, it goes through so many hands \nthat, um, at, at times it becomes an issue and, and the \nreason we got into that was because a lotta guys, uh, \noften times would hold their overtime slips or would, \nwouldn't turn 'em in on time and typically what it is is \nthe Tuesday, uh, before the, the last day of the pay \nperiod which, uh, is the week of payday, you're to submit \nall overtime, uh, uh, slips so that it could be on that \n37 \n1 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nweek's, at that, at that, on that check, on that, that \nThursday. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo you could get paid for it. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nSo you can get paid for it. So, \num, you know, we had a lot of issues with that. A lot of \nguys would, not intentionally but sometimes would hold \ntheir, the overtime slips and now it's Tuesday and \nthey're running around and they want Martha to take it \nacross the street and it, it just became very hectic and \nthen they, they, they put a, a, uh, a timeframe on there, \nsaid 8:00 on Tuesday and then they said no, it's gonna \nbe, uh, 10:00 on Tuesday and the issue was that if you \nworked, if you worked on Tuesday overtime, right - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- and you're, you got off at 10:00 \nat night, well that overtime slip was not gonna be on \nthat week's check because it's too late. It had to been, \nbeen in that Tuesday morning. So, a lotta times, um, and \nit was common practice, what they would do is that the \nsergeant would, the supervisor would sign that, that \novertime slip, turn it in so that you can get paid on \nThursday and, and hoping that you show up, right? \nBecause if you didn't show up, I mean you had to show up \nbecause you're being paid, you know, on that week's check \nfor work that you really haven't worked yet. \n38 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nBut this is only on overtime, not \non straight shifts? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nThis was on overtime, right. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So,you were scheduled to \nwork the overtime. Correct me if I'm wrong. You were on \nthe schedule to work the overtime or someone knew you \nwere going to court that day or whatever it was. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nRight. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd they'd sign it beforehand so \nit'd get in. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nOn time. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo if you, on time, and if you \ndidn't show up, what did they do? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, I don't know. I was ****. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. It didn't happen to you? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, I, no, I mean that's, that's \nyour obligation. You gotta show up. You can't, I assume \nthey probably dock you the next, next time around for the \ntime that they, you know, dock you the hours that you \ndidn't, uh, show up for that shift. I mean that's the \nonly fair thing to do. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo and you, normally on your, um, \nchecks do you see about the same amount of money all the \ntime? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI, I do. \n39 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, that, that begs the question \nof if you see something different and you know you didn't \nwork the overtime, is there any obligation on your part \nto report that they got too much money versus just wait \nfor them to dock you? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, well, well, you know. I mean \nyou know if you didn't show up or not. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. So, let's say you didn't \nshow up and you've got - and obviously, this is a \nhypothetical because I'm not sure that you've ever done \nthat. I'm not asking you about that - if you got your \ncheck and it showed you worked 12 hours overtime and you \nknow during that pay period you didn't, what is your \nobligation? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, your obligation is to say \nsomething 'cause it's - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- time that you, you got paid for \nsomethin' you didn't work. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd have you ever had the \nopportunity to do that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, do what? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSee something on your check that \nshouldn't be there and say something. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm. \n40 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAs you called it. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI mean, uh, no 'cause me \npersonally? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nYes. I'm asking you. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nOh, no. For the most part, I mean \nI kinda roundabout kinda know what I'm gonna get paid so, \nobviously, if there's somethin' that's out of whack, I, \nyou know, you gotta say somethin° but either to your \nsupervisor or say hey, I, I got paid or dock me the next \nweek or whatever but I, I can't, uh, recall a situation \nwhere that's happened to me. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay and when you fill out your \novertime slips, uh, what increments of time do you show \non your overtime slips? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, uh, half. You can go half \nhours, half hours. Um, I guess you can go three-quarters \nof an hour if you got technical but, um, it's, you know, \ntypically a, a flat, a flat time unless it's, you know, \nhalf an hour and then you call it half an hour. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd how is it typically that way? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYou stay over 2 hours, you put \n2.5 or, or you just write on there \nuh, 2 hours. Um, \ndifferent people do different things, um, and you just \nput it on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Are there quarter hours? \n41 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nYou said, you, technically there's three-quarter hours or \nthat if you get technical. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, yeah, I, I would assume that \nif you wanted to, you know, nickel and dime 'em for \n15 minutes, you could but it, it just becomes a, \nnightmare, uh. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, what if they, what if you \ndidn't work a full 15 minutes, do you know what the \npolicy and procedure is for how much time you work in \norder to put in for a 15-minute increment or a 20? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, no, I don't know it offhand. \nI'm sure there, there's somethin' out there but. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd what if you come in late and \nyou clock in with your timecard and you're legitimately \nlate? I mean you didn't get held up. You didn't get \nanything like that. Um, do you put in for that overtime \nfor that full half hour or how do you make that decision \nabout what you're gonna put in? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, if you're, if you're late \nand, you know, you're, you know, 10, 15 minutes, which it \nhappens, you know, you take it upon yourself to, to stay \nthe extra 10, 15 minutes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay and when you're working \novertime, let's just say it's maybe a DUI task force or \nsomething like that, are you permitted to leave early? \n42 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nYou're signed up for a 10-hour \nshift, let's say. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIf you're signed up for a 10-hour \nshift, uh, I mean typically you're gonna work the \n10 hours but there's been situations where they've, \nthey've done, uh, DUI checkpoints and if it's dead or \nsomethin' or, you know, after a while people just, you \nknow, you're moping around and if they call it an early \nday, they call it an early day but, uh, yeah, there, I \nmean there's been situations where you leave early. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd do you submit your overtime \nslip for the actual hours worked or the shift that you \nwere assigned? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo, for the actual hours at work. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, tell me a little bit about \nStone Guard overtime, what it is and what the, what the \nreason for it is. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, as, as we know it, um, Stone \nGuarding is a, is a federal grant, um, that is given to, \nit's managed by the, the county through border patrol for \nthe, you know, border crimes that, that, that happen \nwithin, you know, the proximity of the border. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIt's a federal grant and, uh, how \n43 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nit's used, it's, it's been used a lotta different ways. \nUm, it's been used a lot of different ways. It's, uh, at \none point they were using it to supplement patrol. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, so if we were short on, on \npatro, 1, well, let's backtrack. Through, couple years \nago when, when we were taking furloughs as part of our \nnegotiation we were gonna, we were short, we, uh, \n12 hours a pay period so rather than get paid the, uh, \n80 hours, we were getting paid 68. So, what they would \ndo was they would, uh, bring us in for 8 hours of \novertime under Stone Garden to supplement the patrol \nforce and at the same time, they kinda balanced out the, \nthe, the straight 12 hours that you were missing on your \ncheck. So, moneywise it was, it was, it was a wash, um, \nbut it was just being I guess put under Stone Garden. \nThat was. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOh, so you'd work an 8-hour shift. \nWith time and a half, it would make it a 12-hour time. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIt would make it 12, right. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nI got it. Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, so it was handled in a lot of \ndifferent ways and every year was kinda different the way \nthat Stone Garden's been handled. Um, there was a time \nwhere we had to go to the border patrol station for their \n44 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nroll. Roll call is, is what they call mustered. Don't \ncall it roll call, call it mustered. Um, in order to get \nput in for that Stone Garden, uh, time and then after a w \nwhile we didn't go over there. We just did it out of \nhere and then we went back and did it out of there and \nthen there was a time where, uh, we would fill out a, \nsheet, a Stone Garden sheet and, uh, have them sign it, \nhave the border patrol supervisor sign it and there was a \ntime when we put five name, five names on the sheet and \neveryone's hours and they would sign it and then we would \nleave them a copy and bring the original back and then \nafter that they changed it to where we faxed it over and \nthen after that they changed it to where it was one per \nperson and they emailed it and after, so it just kind of, \nyou know, the, the way that we, that we did it and it \njust kinda went all over the place. It just, it changed \nyear by year so there \nsay there's really a, \nthere was trends that \nwasn't really a, you know, I can't \na set way of doin' it. There was, \nwe used. I would call 'em trends \nbut not, not, uh, because it changed so much, uh - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- and so, like I said, we had to \ngo to that roll call. Then after that you don't have to \ngo there anymore. You go **** from the station and it \njust, that's kind of the way it worked, um, so it just. \n45 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd so, that was a whole lotta \nstuff right there so lemme see if I can clear some of \nthat up. So, the first thing you said was in the past or \nit used to be that it was used for furlough days. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nDid that change at some point? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nAt some point, it did. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay and can you tell me what your \nunderstanding was when it changed? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, um, it, it changed as the \nmoney started running out and, and, and the, you know, \nthey're, they're given, the Stone Garden is granted every \nyear. Um, as their contract changed, that changed so \nthat, that went on for about a year and then, um, you \nknow, you get a, a, a full new batch of, of money. There \nwas X amount of dollars in there and, and then they and \nthen after that they didn't do it for, you know, to \nsupplement patrol. They would put sheets on the board \nand, and you sign up if you wanted. It was kind of like \na Stone Garden buffet I called it, you know, and some \nguys signed up for the Stone Garden and some guys didn't, \num, and it just, uh, it, it became a mess because you'd \nsign up and, you know, and, uh, at first there was these \nrules if you sign up and you don't show up, you get \nwritten up and after that you'd sign up and they had \n46 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n2 days, you had, uh, someone else had 2 days to cross \nyour name out if they had more seniority than you and \ntake your spot and it just, it became convoluted and, \nand, and twisted and, uh, but a lotta guys worked that, \nthat Stone Garden. I mean it's, it's, you know, it was, \nit was the, the gravy, um, and a lotta guys worked, \nworked it every, you know, on their days off, every day \noff. You know, I, you know, I, I worked some of it but \nI, I mean I wasn't, like I said, I'm, uh, it just, it \nbecame too, too twisted and convoluted and I, I, I mean I \nworked it here and there but not, just, you know, too \nmuch of, of a pain to, to. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, can you remember a, uh, \napproximate date when furlough Stone Garden stopped? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI wanna say it was in the 2013 or \n2012 contract. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd that's when they said you \ncan't use it for, you can't use Stone Garden for, um, \nfurloughs. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah, to subsi. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nIs that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nRight. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nTo supplant. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nTo, to supplement the - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nTo regular patrol. \n47 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n® regular patrol. Right. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, what was it used for other \nthan, was, was it used\nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n® for anything other than? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nThey used it for everything from, \nuh, uh, surveillance to, you know, you know you worked \nyour patrol shift to, um, the guy that was working Store, \nStone Garden that day had to respond to only the port of \nentry and the border patrol station, um, or along, you \nknow, um, so like I said it just kinda changed as the \ntrend changed and then they would, the way that they \nwould work the Stone Garden was just, just different. It \nwasn't consistent in any way. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, how was, how were furlough \ndays paid for after they stopped that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, we did furloughs for a year. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, so for, for a year, um, we \ngave up a 20, a 20, wait, 26 weeks of, of, of furloughs \nand after they, after that we finished the year. That \nwas it. I mean we went back to working our, our, uh, our \n80 hours every 2 weeks. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd you know this. Were you part \nof the negotiation teams on that or? \n48 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, that's how you know \nthat so well? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nRight. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. I'm not sure I would \nremember that. Okay. So, you did 20, you gave up \n26 weeks of furlough. Is that what you just said? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nRight. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nApproximately. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, do you know if you weren't \nusing Stone Garden overtime for the furloughs, what were, \nwhat, how was it being paid? Do you know that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIf it wasn't being used for Stone \nGarden? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. If Stone Garden wasn't \npaying your furlough days - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- and you worked overtime that \nday, what was paying it? Do you know? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm. Now I'm, I'm confused. I'm \nconfused, \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIf you didn't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nIf you worked overtime - \n49 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nOkay. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- on your furlough day - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nOkay. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- and it was authorized\nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- and it wasn't okay to use Stone \nGarden overtime grants to pay for that furlough day that \nyou worked overtime - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- what bucket of money might that \novertime pay come from? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, duri, duri, I know that \nduring that contract, it just came out of that, that \nStone Garden bucket, um, and I wanna say, I wanna say \nthat towards the last, uh, the last weeks of, of, of our, \nyou know, the last weeks that we were on that furlough, \nyou know, people just, you know, bit the bullet on the, \non the, on the 68 hours, you know, and not everyone \nworked their Stone Garden either. Um, you have the, the, \nuh, the option of not comin' in on that day, on your \nStone. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nFor the option if you signed up? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo, no, no. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nOn your, on your furlough day - \n50 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n-7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOh, yeah. Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n® because you're, you're, you're, \nyou know, on the day that you weren't supposed to be here \nfor 12 hours, um, they gave you the opportunity to come \nin for 8 hours of Stone Garden. Well, a lotta guys \nrather than, than come in would, would take the day off. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nSo, you know, so now they got, \nit's, you know, a, a, 2 day, they only worked 2 days or \nvice versa, whatever, instead of working the 7 days they \nwould work 6. Some guys went that route. They didn't, \nthey just get paid the 68 hours and, and down the road. \nThey, they went in that over that, those 8 hours that \nthat officer was supposed to work. Well, then someone \ncould easily suck those up if you wanted to work \novertime. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, do you know at all if asset \nforfeiture funds was being used to pay for Stone Garden, \nI mean for furlough days? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, there is a possibility. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nThere's a possibility. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, um, can you tell me, you, you \nmentioned something about the signup lists everywhere. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm hmm. \n51 \n1 \n2 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd people would sign up and then \npeople wouldn't and do you know what those signups lists \nwere based on? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, well, the different shifts. \nUm, certain days they needed, uh, X amount of, of, of \nguys out there and, like I said, it wasn't, it wasn't \nreally consistent. It, it kinda depended on how much \nmoney or, or if, if we, if we pissing one off or not, you \nknow? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIt, you know, it's like hey, guys, \nyou know, you guys are, you know, over there causing a \nruckus. Okay, there's no more Stone Garden. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWe're not gonna release it until. \nSo now you got all these guys running around like, you \nknow, where's my Stone Garden money? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight 'cause they're depending on \nthat - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nEverything on that. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- for things that they shouldn't \nhave, yes. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nRight. Right. And so, you know, \nnow they're scrambling and, uh, and then, you know, they \nwould throw a couple sheets up there, couple spots and, \n52 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nyou know, now everyone's fighting for how many, you know, \nyou've got, put your name up there and someone crosses it \nout and it, it just be, it became a, a mess, um, and, uh, \nlike I said, at first, uh, you know, there was the, the, \nthey would put the sheet, the Calexico policy, if you \nfailed to show up and then, of course, people would sign \nup, be greedy and, and then some people the day that \nthey're supposed to, hey, you know what? I'm not gonna \ngo. I'm calling in sick, \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nAnd it just, it, you know, that's \nkinda the way it worked. There was really no total \nconsistency of it. It was just kinda like a trend. \nSometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, was there any time that you \nwould work Stone Garden overtime when there wasn't a \nsignup list? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, yeah, certainly. There was a \nlot ****. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Tell me when that would \nhappen. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, if you had the, if you had \nsomethin' goin' on in an investigation or somethin' like \nthat. I know there's, there's situations where, where I \nmighta worked a, you know, we're doin' surveillance on \n53 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nsomething or, or, you know, there, we got somethin' goin' \non and it's just put it under Stone Garden or, uh, you \nknow, people are doin' somethin' else and they would just \nput it under Stone Garden. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd how would you know that you \ncould put it under Stone Garden? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, they'd, they'd tell you put \nit under. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nWho is they? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, your supervisor, whoever's in \ncharge. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd did it have to comply with any \nguidelines in order to be considered Stone Garden? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, the big thing was that they \nhad a, uh, link it, annex it to the, to the border, um. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nSo I, you know, I mean I guess, I \nmean just do somethin' around, you know, traffic stop \naround the border, get, but, you know, go check on the \nborder and now it's annexed. That's kinda the way that, \nthat, uh. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd so you may have done that once \nin a shift and the rest of the shift you're doin' \nsomethin' else? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYou might be doin' somethin' else. \n54 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay and was there anybody that \ntold you well, no, you have to work the entire time on \nall of this stuff rather than on, um, just do that one \nthing at the border? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, I mean the rule was there but \npeople never really, never did it. Typically if, uh, \nonce they started, once the, the Stone Garden started \nrunning out, you would know when they would start to run \nout because the lists would, the lists would be shorter \nand shorter. It wasn't five sheets up. There was two \nspots. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nAnd, uh, obviously, whoever was in \ncharge of that patrol shift, um, wanted the Stone Garden \nguy to go, you know, go do the warrants at the port or if \nthere was, you know, someone with dope or anything that \nhad to deal with the port, then they want that Stone \nGarden guy to do it because it would alleviate a lot of, \nuh, you know, it would alleviate one of his guys from his \nshift so, um, it, it all depended. You know, it, some \nguys did it, some guys didn't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, would there ever be times when \nyou or anyone else would work shifts? So, you're saying \nthere are shifts. Were they a time period like from 10 \nto 10 or 7 to 2 or anything like that? Were those \n55 \n1 \n3 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwritten up there, the times that the shifts were? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah. Sometimes, there, there was \ntimes. There was days and times, yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd were there, were there times \nwhen you or other peopl , and then we'll get down to \nwhether you did it, um, ever worked beyond or outside \nthose shift times? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI'm sure, I'm sure they did or we \ndid, yeah. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd under what circumstances would \nthat happen? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, something came up, you're told \nto stay or maybe someone called in sick or, uh, not, \nthere's a lot of possibilities the way ****. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMight there also be times when \npeople would be, uh, signed up for Stone Garden and the \nshift didn't start 'til 7 and they, uh, 10 and they got \noff at 7 and they'd stay before, through that time and \nput in for Stone Garden overtime? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah. I mean, you know, it, Stone \nGarden was, there was the, the list and there was the, I \nguess the, the, the freestyle list so I mean it all just, \nuh, Stone Garden, it all depended and it all depended on, \nuh, different chief did it different ways, uh, and, you \nknow, we went through I think, you know, uh, two chiefs \n56 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwith, with Stone Garden and they, they, you know, each \none of those chiefs did it a, a different way. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nHave you ever been responsible for \nsetting up, uh, Stone Garden details?\nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, not that I recall. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, can you tell me, you \nsaid different chiefs do it different ways. Can you tell \nme how Chief Tabarez did it? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, well, I don't, I mean he \nwasn't really, I don't know what, what directive he gave, \ngave the people that were in charge of Stone Garden. At, \nuh, at one time it was, uh, uh, the lieutenants in charge \nof Stone Garden. Another time it was the sergeants in \ncharge of Stone Garden. Um, so it was. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nCan you tell me what, under \nTabarez how did Stone Garden work? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, I mean there was the same \nthing. There was a list - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- and, uh, people signed up and, \nuh, there was also, um, I know that investigations, there \nmighta been some occasions where we worked, uh, some \nStone Garden that's, you know, either on surveillance or \njust, uh, you know, an, we would annex anything to the \nborder and, and work it so it wasn't a, a list. It was \n57 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthe investigations, uh, sergeant that would say hey, \nwell, um, today, you guys wanna work Stone Garden, you \nguys want, you know. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nWere you done with your thought? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI was, I was, I thought you had a \nquestion for me. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nNo, no, just lookin' up waitin' \nfor you to finish with your thought. Okay. Okay. Um, \nwhen you worked Stone Garden overtime before you went \ninto investigation, is it in uniform or out of uniform? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, I did in, in, uh, in uniform. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd were you, um, in black and \nwhites as well? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nBlack and whites. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nWas there ever a time when you \nweren't in uniform or you weren't in your black and \nwhite? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, there was, um, yeah, there was \ntimes where we, we were doin' somethin' that we jumped \nout of, uh, uniform and other people as well would work \nStone Garden out of uniform. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd under what circumstances would \nthat happen? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, if they were doin' some, like \nI said, surveillance or at a case or a narcotics case or \n58 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthey were workin' somethin' with the border patrol agent \nthat they, they worked out of our, uh, investigations \noffice. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd that's Fuentes? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, there was two. There was \nFuentes and then there was, uh, uh, Gomez. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nYeah. Gomez. I was trying to \nremember. Okay. Um, were there any of the Stone Garden \nshifts that required a supervisor or were all of them\nokay, maybe this is \nStone Garden shifts \nyour knowledge? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \na question. \nthat didn't \nWere there any of the \nrequire a supervisor to \nUh, to my knowledge, uh, no. To \nmy knowledge, you were supposed to, uh, if you came in, \nsome guys came in for Stone Garden, um, you know you're \nsupposed to let the, the on-shift, uh, supervisor know \nthat you're here and workin' Stone Garden but that wasn't \nalways the case. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nWere there any of those times that \nStone Garden was assigned where a supervisor was \nidentified as one of those shifts? You're, okay, that \nwas not very good. You're right. I like that question \nlook on your face. Okay. Was there any time when they \nhad Stone Garden, um, signup lists - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMm hmm. \n59 \n3 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n® and the signup sheet provided \nfor signup by a supervisor? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Were all of them that way? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, no, not, not all the lists but \nthere was, uh, there was some lists that, uh, where there \nwas a, a supervisor, a, a spot up there. In fact, that, \nthat kinda became a, a, an issue for a while there \nbecause, um, you know, the people would sign up and if a \nsupervisor would come along, you know, he would bump that \nguy, that guy that was there so before you know it, you \nknow, that supervisor is bumping all these guys and, uh, \nit, it became a little, a little hectic because, um, I \nmean I, I didn't think, I mean I, I didn't think it was \nfair that, that a supervise, just because he's a \nsupervisor that he would just bump, you know, uh, you \nknow, just a regular, a regular guy, you know? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nWell, how did, how did that, how \ndid that happen? Was it because of seniority or was \nthere some other thing being planned? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, it was, it was based on, it \nwas based on seniority but they did, at one point for a \nwhile there, they had a, a spot for a supervisor. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nAnd so if, say if, um, there was \n60 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthree spots, one supervisor, two officers, um, and, uh, \nno one, no supervisor signed up so now you got three guys \nup there - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- just regular patrol officers. \nThen a supervisor comes along. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nAnd he take that, it's like hey, \nI'm, you know, kinda move out the way. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nThat's my supervisor. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nThat's my supervisor spot, you \nknow? And, you know, it, it became a little bit of a \nconflict because I, I mean I thought it was kinda \nbullshit that, you know, why are these guys getting \nbumped like that. I mean that's, that's not fair. I \nmean if, first of all, you know, you wait 'til the last \nminute and you can't just decide the last minute that you \nneed Christmas money or gas money and bump this guy that \nalready made plans and, and you know? I just. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd did it ever happen when there \nwasn't a supervisor spot there and it was just all \nofficer spots? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah and there and, and that was, \nthat was my, that was the argument that sometimes there \nwasn't a, a supervisor for whatever reason. Maybe they, \n61 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nyou know, they were already fed up with Stone Garden or \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- they were maxed out, whatever \nthe situation was and so then at, you know, when it was \nconvenient for them, then it was okay to put out, you \nknow, to have all three of those guys officers but when \nit wasn't convenient, then now you, you're bumpin', \nbumpin' my guys. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd they're in the same bargaining \nunit as you? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWe're, we're all in the same \nbargaining unit so. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Okay. Okay. So, um, let's \ncontinue on with Stone Garden, um. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nCan I get, get some ****? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nYes, you may. **** water right \nthere. **** brought it right over for you. Give you a \nchance to get a little drink. Do you wanna take a break \nor are you, you okay? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nActually, I, I do need to go to \nthe restroom. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, why don't we do that? \nIt's, uh, 11, 11:02. We're gonna go off for a little \nbreak here. So, let's pause here. Okay. We're, it's \nnow 11:07, maybe 8 and we're back on tape. Uh, we still \n62 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nhave Mr. Di Giovanni and Officer Casillas in the room. \nOkay. So, the last we were talking was Stone Garden and \nbefore we get into this report, daily activity report, \num, I need to follow up on one other thing. When you go \nout in the field and I wanna know what your practice is, \nokay? We talked about the MDC and sometimes it doesn't \nwork and sometimes it does. When you get, when you do a \ntraffic stop, how, how does that go down? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nLet's say you're drivin' around \nand you see a violation. You decide to do a traffic \nstop. Could you kinda walk me through how that works? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, see a violation, you, you call \nout what we, a 960, um, call out the, uh, the plate and \nyour location and, uh, if it doesn't have a, a plate, you \nknow, 916 and you identify the vehicle on the move Chevy \nMalibu and if it does a plate, then you go with the plate \nand, and always a location, um, typically. Um, is there \ntimes where you do a, a traffic stop and you don't call \nit out, call it in? Yes, there has been. I mean there \nis. Sometimes there is. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd under what circumstances would \nthat occur? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, you know, maybe they got \nemergency radio traffic on the, on the radio or, or \n63 \n1 \n3 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthere's multiple units out there, you know, you got a \nbunch of units working overtime and, and, uh, you know, \nwe try to, uh, keep the, the radio traffic to, to a \nminimum, uh, so there, I mean there is situations where \nyou don't, you don't call it in but I would say that, you \nknow, 90 percent of the time I call it in, at least I \ncall it in. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd what's the purpose for calling \nit in? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, officer safety. You wanna \nmake sure that if something goes sideways they know where \nyou're at and, and, uh, you know, for, for your safety \nand the safety of the person you pulled over. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nIs there any policy or procedure \nthat requires you to call in on everything that you do? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI'm sure there is. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, I, I don't know it offhand. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nBut I would venture to say I'm \nsure there is. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, in your practice, you would \nsay 90 percent of the time you call in your traf, traffic \nstops. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nMost of the time, yeah. \n64 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, I'm looking at, um, \nwhat's called your Operation Stone Garden and this is a \n2014 daily activity report. I'm gonna show it to you. \nDoes this look familiar? It's a blank one. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nUh. \nI cannot **** blank. \nYes, it's ****. \nA template? \nA template that we, that we use. \nAnd did you use this template or \nhow did you, what did you use to submit your Stone Garden \novertime? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, well, we used different, \ndifferent methods. This looks like a, a template that \nwas on, on the comp, that was on my computer or on a, on \na flash drive. Um, we've, I've used those in the past \nand then I've also used the regular black and white, uh, \nblank sheet with, without the color, um. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd are those both available on \nsome community drive or something? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, yeah. Everyone kinda has \n'em. If you don't have it, you can always get one from \nsomeone else. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd when you do Stone Garden \novertime, what, uh, what is required in addition to your \n65 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nregular overtime slip? And I kinda got ahead of it but \nis the DAR required as well? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes, the, the, along with the, \nwith the Cal, with our overtime slip, you're supposed to \nattach one of these to the, to the slip and it's supposed \nto coincide with the, the date and the time on, on the \nslip. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nDo you physically print it out or \nis it sent via email? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nHow does that work? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIt works both ways, um. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYou could email it\nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- to whoever is in charge over \nthere or, uh, you can physically take it over there and \nphysically get it signed, that's and, uh, or at one time \nwe faxed it over so it all depends. Uh, this one here \nlooks like this is the one that you email to, to that \nname up there and some guys emailed it, some guys faxed \nit, some guys, um, got it, got it signed. I know that \nI've done all three ways so. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, do you only email it to that \nperson or do you email it to anyone else in the \n66 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \norganization or outside? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, when you email, I've only done \nit a, I'm, uh, I'm not a big email guy so I mean that, \nyeah, to whatever is up there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nI don't know if that's the person \nthat's in charge of it now. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd you said you take it over \nthere. Where is over there? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, if you get it hand-signed, \num, you take it to the border patrol station, which is, \nuh, just east of, of Calexico outside of the city limits. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, let's go through and could you \ntell me how you fill this out and what and we're still \nlooking at that template. I'm seeing right here that \nit's Operation Heat Wave. So is that the name of \nwhatever operation there is? What is that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, I would assume that's, that's \nwhat they, they named the, the Stone Garden operation. \nI, I couldn't tell you. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nDo you remember there being an \nOperation Heat Wave? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, no but - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- the time, uh, matches, you know, \n67 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ncoincides with our climate here so. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nYes, it does. Okay. So, it says \nstate local agency and under it says Calexico. So, it \nlooks like this is partially filled out for something. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nCalexico Border Patrol. Calexico \nOperation ****. \nWhen you fill this out, what do you put \nin the date and hours period? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, well, you put the, the date \nand then the, the hours that you worked, uh, you know, \n1700 to 23 or whatever the hours you worked and then, uh, \nthe date that, that you worked it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, is that the date the hours of \nyour shift or hours you actually worked? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUm, the hours, it could, could, I \nguess it could essentially be both, the hours that you \nworked, um, and well, typically, it's supposed to be the \nhour of the shift that you signed up for. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nBut that's not always the case \nbecause if you're, if you're, if you're on patrol, you're \ngonna have, uh, the date and the time on the sheet that's \ngotta coincide with this but if you're doing some other, \ngo sit on the border, let's wait for this truck to, you \nknow, this load to come north or whatever. Then your, \n68 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nyour time and date is not, it's gonna be different. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, when you're drive, uh, okay, \nso that kinda was \ngood question or you created a good \nquestion for me. So, when you're sent out on patrol and \nyou, you sit on the border, um, do you just drive out to \nwherever that place is and just sit? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nUh, it all depends. I mean if, if \nthey have somethin' for you\nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- then, then you do whatever they \nhave for you and I'll give you an example. We also have, \num, uh, officers that, well, assigned to the, to the ICE, \nuh, to CBP and ICE so if they got somethin' going on and \nthey need a, you know, a, an, a traffic stop from a black \nand white, then you, you just kinda mope around the area \nand it's a, it's a, it's a wait game until that vehicle \ngoes north and, you know, they want an FI so you're gonna \npull it over. You're gonna find PC, pull it over and \nthey want ****. \nThey'd think that the car is loaded so \nyou're gonna pull it over, do a traffic stop and call the \ndog or whatever the situation, uh, you know, a wall stop \nor somethin' so if that's the case, yeah, you, sometimes \nyou just sit there and one and find a nice shade and sit \nthere until that car goes north or sometime you're just \ndriving around. It all depends. \n69 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo, you brought up, uh, FIs. How \ndo you document your FIs? If they want an FI, you said, \nyou said if they want an FI, you write an FI. How is \nthat documented and how do they get it and what kinda \npiece of paper is it on or if it, is it on a piece of \npaper or is it on computer? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, we, we, we have FI cards but \nwe don't always use 'em. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nSo, if they wanna a, an FI and, \nand you pull the, the doc, you know, if they, I want the \ndriver, I want the, the passenger, um, you know, you \nobviously, you know, after they get pulled over and, and \nyou run 'em, um - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- you either jot it down on your, \non your notepad or, or you put it, you know, over, over \nthe air. Um, you give the, the, the, the, uh, the ICE \nagent or, or whoever is, you know, inquiring the \ninformation the information, here you go. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd you would simply read it off \nyour notebook or a piece of paper or whatever you have? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah. Just a, you know, we, our \nnotepad, you know, Juan Basket's, uh, DOB, address and \nthen, obviously, you know you're runnin' for, for, for \n70 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwarrants and stuff like that and you can print it up, \nprint it up, mark it white if they're in a white car, \nprint it up, mark it green if they're in a green car. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nMm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nAnd they can either come back to \nthe station pick up the, the, you know, or if that's \ngonna suffice, then you just give 'em the notepad and \nthen, yeah \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd what do you, what are you \nreferring to a notepad? Is it just literally a notepad - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah, it's just. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- or is a field officer's notebook \nor is it a? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIt's, uh, you know, our, our, our \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nI'm gettin' chilled. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- our, it's just our, our notepad \nthat we carry, just a. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. Is it the small one - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nSmall. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n- that fits in your pocket? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nPocket. Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay 'cause I noticed there were \nsome yellow notepads on the thing but they look too big \nto fit in your pocket. \n71 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nSo it's not that. It's just. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nWell, some people, you know, me \npersonally I prefer the, you know, the old little \nnotepads with the leath, leather wallet. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nRight. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nAnd some guys, you know, prefer \nthe, you know, the, the yellow ones. It, it ail, it's \nall preference but, uh, you write it, jot it on, jot down \nthe information on there and give it to. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n'Cause, 'cause in my, in my \nexperience, we had actual what we called field officer \nnotebooks and, and it was kinda this bound little one \nthat fit right in your pocket. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYeah, little white ones. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd then on the back side you have \nyour Miranda rights, that you could have that there in \ncase you needed it or some other information so that it \nwas available but you don't have anything, uh. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNothin' that's assigned to us. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nYou know, it, but it's, it's \nsimilar. It just, it's. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nAnd what do you do with all of \nthat information after you've jotted it down? I mean do \n72 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nyou maintain it anyplace? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nNo. I mean sometimes if, uh, \nwell, if they want the information on that particular \nperson, you just tear it off and give it to the, to the \nagent. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nIf they want a, uh, a, you know, \na printout then they gotta come by dispatch and, and \npick it up. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nOkay. So, continuing on with this \ndaily activity report, um, it says here name of officer. \nDo you insert that in there? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, yes - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - you put your name on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And then the overtime hours, what \nis that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, the, I guess the, how many hours \nyou, you worked. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And should that con, that be \nconsistent with the date and hours that you - \nLUIS CASILLAS: It - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - worked? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - it should. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Who puts in the overtime \n73 \n1 \n2 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nrate, do you? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah, we, yeah, we take a stab at \nit. It's, uh, approximate. I mean we, they were, you \nknow, you just kind of estimate it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: You kind of say oh, I'm, I'm - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Over - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - I think - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - time 50 bucks an - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - 50 bucks an hour. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - hour, uh. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And do you put in the labor cost, \ndo you do the calculation on that - \nLUIS CASILLAS: We - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - based on that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - yeah, we, we, we, uh, based on \nyour approximation. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, 'cause - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And you - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - that's not the \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - enter that, right? You enter \nthat? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: But that's now, whatever you put on \n74 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthere, it's not what you're gonna, 'cause I, everyone has \na different overtime rate. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Right. \nLUIS CASILLAS: And so everyone's rate is different. \nI mean if you, you really have to get down to the, I mean \nI couldn't tell you what my rate is now, so I kind of, \nuh, guess. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And it may change with the \ndifferent - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Ya, yeah, I mean the, that's just a \nBETTY KELEPECZ: MOU or some negotiations you've \ndone, you - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n- basic * * * * \nWhatever we put on there, it's more \nof a formality that they're - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Yep. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - gonna put whatever you get, you \nactually get paid. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: They're gonna do the actual \nLUIS CASILLAS: The actual. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - calculations eventually, okay. \nUnder here, it says mileage costs. Do you know why they \nhave a section that says mileage costs? \n75 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: Um, no, but - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - it was about the vehicle that you \nwere in, uh\nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - if it's a black and white, you put \nthe, the number. Um, if it's unmarked and, I guess, you \nwould identify it by whatever - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Like - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - **** that you're - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - gray = \nLUIS CASILLAS: - **** \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - Fusion. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - Fusion. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Gray Fusion, which is what you \nnormally. And what is this mileage start? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, it's supposed to be the start \nmileage of the, of the, when you started working, uh, \nthe, the overtime hours. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: The 0, odometer reading, when - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Odometer reading. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - you started out in your car? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And the mileage end - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \n76 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - the same thing, it's the odometer \nreading? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And mileage total, how does - \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's the total - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - that - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - mileage of the odometer reading. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Arid how do you deter, uh, is, do \nyou put that in or does somebody else calculate that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No, we, we put it in. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So based on your mileage \nstart and mileage end, you determine what the mileage \ntotal is? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And, um, equipment and \nmaintenance costs, do you have anything to do with that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No, that's kind of, you, you kind of \nleave that one blank. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And you know what, I am not \nseeing something on this. There should be a second page \non this, correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, I don't know. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Because I'm not seeing a narrative \nand the boxes. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes, yes, some of 'em do have, um, \n77 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nboxes for, uh, this one doesn't but boxes for FIs or \narrest or, uh - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And the narrative. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - narrative or what you cease or \nwhatever situation you're in. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So in those situations, in the \nnarrative part, what are you supposed to put in the \nnarrative? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Um, we do a little summary. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Of what you've been doing during \nthat shift? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yep. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Do you ever put anything else in \nthe narrative? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Um, no, I mean it's, most narratives \nare the same. I mean patrolled along the, the United \nStates, Mexico International Border. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And are you, we talked about check \nboxes, what are those for and I'm gonna show you one of \nyours from November 6th, 2013. Here is the front page and \nhere is the back page, it kind of did the opposite, but, \num, here is the narrative for yours. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Total all costs $200.00. Um, so \nthis would be some more to the narrative you might use? \n78 \n2 \n3 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes, it's - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - you, you kind of, uh, fill - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - that out to the best of your \nability. If you had some **** or, uh, you, you know, \nwhatever boxes apply here. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So underneath the narrative, \nyou're putting in what you did. Do you ever reuse the \nsame narrative? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, oftentimes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And in the check box, what is \nexpected to be put in there and what circumstances? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, um, you know, you've got, if \nyou picked, uh, someone up with a warrant out of the, the \nport of entry, you would, uh, jot that done or if you did \nany, uh, um, arrested anyone or, or citations. I don't \nsee the cit, whatever boxes applies, you, you fill out. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And this isn't yours, by the way, I \njust realized it's someone else's but, um, you put in so \nlet's go through each one of those. Um, citations \nissued, it, it has vehicle searches - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \n79 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: ® that's how many times you \npersonally searched a vehicle? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, well yeah, you, if you searched, \nuh, or if you helped or if you searched a\nBETTY KELEPECZ: Thank you. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \na car, you would, you would \nfill that box out. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: What about citations issued, were \nthose citations you wrote? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, could or I assisted someone with \na citation. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And how would anyone know if you \nassisted someone with a citation? \nLUIS CASILLAS: How would they know? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Right, that this isn't your four \ncitations. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, well, if you were the, if there \nwas someone else there at, at, at the, at those traffic \nstops, I guess. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. But you would put in here \nany citations you wrote and any citations you assisted \non? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, if, for the purpose of, of the \nstats, we just, if I, if I, uh, roll up on, on one of \nyour traffic stops and you get a citation, you know, I \n80 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nwould put it as I assisted you with the citation. It \ndoesn't always mean, mean that I'm the one that gave the \ncitation. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Right. But where is it that you \nknow the difference - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Oh, well I - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - between the two? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - there, you couldn't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So there's a possibility of \na duplication of stats, statistics? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. For field interviews, are \nthose field interviews you personally conducted? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, same thing. You know, if you \nassisted someone and, and, and, uh, they had, you know, a \ncouple guys on the curb and I would, uh, if I assisted \nsome, assisted someone then I would put down, uh, those \ninterview cards, I mean the ****. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And so if, if you assisted \non an arrest, you'd, may put an arrest, it may have been \nyour arrest, it could have been someone else's arrest? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Right. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: If it's a traffic stop, if you \nrolled on a traffic stop and backed on that traffic stop, \nyou, I may be your guy that's stopped, it may be somebody \n81 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nelse's? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Sometimes you voice those traffic \nstops, sometimes you don't. \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's correct. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. What is this, IA turned over \nto BP? What is that? Do you have any nine, idea what \nthat - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, yeah - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - means? \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nuh, IA is an illegal alien, so \nlike the - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Ah. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - if you, uh, you know, contacted an \nillegal alien and, uh, he was undocumented \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Mm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - and you, uh, turned him over to, \nuh, border patrol. You assisted 'em and you could put \nthat there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And that should be whatever their \nbadge number is? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, yes. I mean I, yeah, that would \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Who you - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - turned - \n82 \n1 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - turned over - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \nover to. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - to? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So if you turned it over to a BP \nagent, you're expected to get the star number, which is \ntheir badge - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, the - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - number? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - badge number, um - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: What does that mean, agent's star \nnumber? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I guess that would be their, their, \ntheir, uh, their badge number. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Ah, that's what I was kind of \nthinking but I was hoping you'd help me out with that \n'cause I'm, I'm not sure. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah, their, they got long serial \nnumbers. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And do they have a number on their \nbadge? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No, they, I think they, I want to \nsay they have it behind the badge - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - number **** on the back. \n83 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Oh, okay, on the back side where - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Back side. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - you can read it? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Right. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay, * * * * \nOkay, this is where \nstart getting confused, so this will be confusing for me \nas well. So when you turn this overtime slip in and you \nturn this DAR in, is it expected that whatever is on this \novertime slip is gonna be consistent with the, what this \nsays - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - the DAR? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, that's, that's what's \nexpected. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n* * * * \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Have you ever, to your knowledge, \nturned in an overtime slip that was inconsistent with \nyour DAR? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, actually, yeah, I'm sure I've \nmade, um, a lot of mistakes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Are there are any requirements that \nthis be filled out completely? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, yeah, if you want to get paid, \nit, it's required that, that this be attached to that. \n84 \n1 \n3 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And be completely filled out? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh\nBETTY KELEPECZ: In other words, you put your \nmileage day, you put your overtime hours, all, fill in \nall those spots? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, you're supposed to fill it out, \nuh, completely but, you know, oftentimes, you, once \nagain, bad habits and just poor habits and poor \nrecordkeeping, sometimes you, you don't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And does anything happen if you \ndon't fill that out completely - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - to your knowledge? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Not, not to my knowledge. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Do you specifically recall any time \nwhere you didn't fill that out and why, um, why you \ndidn't? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Nothing that pops out but I'm sure \nthat I've, uh, that I've done that. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And, um, should your \novertime slip and your DAR be, also be consistent with \nwhatever timecard you have? \nLUIS CASILLAS: They should. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: It, I'm sure it doesn't always work \n85 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthat way. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And why wouldn't it work that way? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, you make mistakes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And what do you mean by make \nmistakes? How could you make mistakes where they don't, \nthey aren't consistent? \nLUIS CASILLAS: You make mistakes, I, you know, \nwhere I, I'm human and I, I make mistakes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So can you explain to me what type \nof mistakes you might make where they would not be \nconsistent with the - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - each other? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - why would it, mistake on the day, \nmistake on the time, um, you know, there's, there's, uh, \nI'm sure a number of, uh, ways that I can, uh, you know, \nscrew that up. I, uh, as simple as it may seem, there's \na possibility that I could make mistakes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Okay. Okay, so I'm gonna \nstart going through some specific overtime slips and \nDARs, and talk to you a little bit about those Stone \nGarden ones, so, uh, the first one is dated November 6th\nand I assume that's 2013 from 1500 to 1900. I'm gonna \npass it on over to you and I'm gonna ask you to review \nthat with me today. So do you, um, you notice that \n86 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthere's no, um, year or date on there. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So how do we know which year this \nwas. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Um. \nOTHER SPEAKER: Well the header right there says \n2013 daily activity report. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So and that was Mr. Di \nGiovanni that said that. \nOTHER SPEAKER: Sorry, I thought you were asking, I \nmean - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah. \nOTHER SPEAKER: - it seemed - \nLUIS CASILLAS: I mean - \nOTHER SPEAKER: - pretty obvious that there's a \nLUIS CASILLAS: - it's right up there - \nOTHER SPEAKER: - it's year dated. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - on the top. I - \nOTHER SPEAKER: So - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - I didn't notice it but yeah, there \nis a 2013 up there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nOTHER SPEAKER: Sorry, I'm very observant. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Yeah, I know, I know. So, uh, is \nthis your name - \n87 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n**** \nLUIS CASILLAS: - that's - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nCasillas. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - my name. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And this is how many hours you \nworked? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And this is what you're kind of, \noh, your $50.00 rate, overtime - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - rate? Okay. And so here it said \nyou worked from 1500 to 1900 hours, is that correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, I guess, that's what's on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So let's look at your unit \nnumber. Can you tell me a little bit about Unit No. 570? \nDo you know what that one is and can you re, recall \nanything specific about it? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Other than what it says on there, \nno, I don't, I don't know any of 'em personally or I \ndon't have a, a, a, a personal unit. If it says it's a \nFord, uh, Crown Victoria, it's Unit 570. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So could you kind of look at \nthose numbers that say mileage - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \n88 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - start and mileage end and tell me \nhow many miles that is? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Um, uh, 137,796 and then the next \nnumber is 137,859. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Correct. And how many miles does \nthat make? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, it probably makes more than \nthe 20 that says total mileage. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Can you tell me how that \nmight happen? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Um, mistakes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So how might you have made \nthat mistake? So if this is a calculation and that's \nsupposed to be the mileage total based on the subtraction \nof this from this - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - how might you have made that \nmistake and putting 20 instead of, what is that number? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah, well I - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Let's do a calc for me 'cause I'm \nhaving trouble, 137,859 minus 137,796, let's see, 9, 10, \n11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 63 miles. \nLUIS CASILLAS: If that's what the calculation came \nup. How, how I made the mistake, I just, that, uh, but, \nyou know, sloppy, uh, recordkeeping. I mean I made \n89 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nmistakes, I'm not, I'm not 100 percent. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Okay, so let's also look \nover to, um, No. 6, yeah. Excuse me. Okay, is that **** \nthere, so these are all **** let's \nAnd do you know if this DAR is your \ndo you ever sign the bottom of this \ngo to No. 8. Okay. \nDAR? In other words, \nor have it together? \nAre they one side and the other side of a paper or how \ndoes - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - that work? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - some are, it's, at one point, \nthere were, uh, two sheets. At one point, they were one \nsheet. Then they went to, then they put 'em on the \ncomputer so is that mine, it's got my name on there, I \nwould assume that it, that it's mine. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And what does it say \nregarding how many citations and how many arrests and \nfield interviews you have here? I don't think that one \nis yours. To tell you the truth, I don't think it is. \nthink - \nLUIS CASILLAS: It's got my name on it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: It's got your name on this side but \nnot on this side. You see what I'm saying? Okay. \nThat's why this was in here. So this is Victor Flores on \nthe same date, 1500 to 1900. This goes here. See what \n90 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nI'm saying? This is the second page of this one. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Because I can get it up on the \ncomputer like that but they printed out and it flows into \nthe next one and how I know that is this says $50.00 and \nit's $200.00 and this says $200.00 over here, whereas \nthis one says 20541 and so the next one would be 20541. \nSo based on this, would you have expected that you issued \nfour citations and had eight FIs and anything else there \nthat I'm missing 'cause I'm looking upside down? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, I mean what's the question? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: You see these boxes? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Would you expect that if I were to \nlook into the system or someplace - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - that you have written four \ncitations, done eight FIs and five traffic stops. \nLUIS CASILLAS: If you looked into the system, would \nthat be in there? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Yeah, that's, would you expect it \nto be in there? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, you would expect it but not, \nnot necessarily, it might not necessarily be in there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And under what circumstances might \n91 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nnot that be - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - in the system? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - uh, once again, I might have, uh, \nused an old template, got lazy and, and just left \nwhatever numbers were on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And what about the citations? If \nyou said you did four citations, it's because it was an \nold template and you left - \nLUIS CASILLAS: It - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - those numbers - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - that - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - on - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - I mean that's - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - there? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - that's a possibility. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. What might another reason \nbe? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, that's the only reason I can \nthink of. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So, um, related to this, \nwe've already kind of figured out that those numbers \ndon't match those numbers, would you expect, um, that \nthese numbers would match whatever the mileage is for \nthat vehicle, either on the mileage log or someplace \n92 \n1 \n2 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nelse? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Um, you would expect it but I, once \nagain, I might have made a mistake or used a sloppy, uh, \ntemplate. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So when you take mileage \nstart, how do you determine that? Do you actually read \nit off the odometer? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, sometimes or sometimes I jot \nit down on my notepad or, you know, I guesstimate at the \nend of the end of the shift. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So tell me how you do that, I mean, \nuh, guesstimate? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, you just look at the ending \nand estimate how many miles you drove around and take a \nstab at it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: It's, um, how, I know, I don't \nthink I understand that, so you just take a stab at how \nmany miles you might have driven that day? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So this may not be accurate \nbecause you did not actually take down the mileage or \nwhat - \nLUIS CASILLAS: That - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - happened? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - it might not be accurate because I \n93 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nmight have either made a mistake or just got sloppy or \nused a old template or just guessed, was too lazy to \ncheck the car. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And under those \ncircumstances, you would guesstimate? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah, I did that a lot of times. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Do you know what this information \nis used for? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I have no clue other than it, that's \nsomething that we need to fill out to get paid. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And do you believe that when you \nfill it out, it's supposed to be accurate? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, it's supposed to be but, uh, \nobviously, not always, there's a lot of mistakes on there \nthat I made. Bless you. \nOTHER SPEAKER: Thanks. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Bless you. Okay, so did you ever \nguesstimate the odometer readings at the beginning and \nthe end, and, um, how would you guesstimate odometer \nreadings? First, do you, have you ever done that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, I had looked at the odometer \nreading at the end and I probably just estimated how many \nmiles I drove around and subtracted it. Somehow I est, \nI, the, uh, I might have estimated it or used an old \ntemplate. \n94 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay, so you, either you used an \nold template or you guesstimated. From this information, \nwould you expect that car mileage to be consistent with \nthe vehicle mileage for that car? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Not if I estimated it. I, it could \nbe different, I, um \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So sometimes you would make up \nboth? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, you don't make it up, you \nestimate it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So if you get in the car and \nyou start down the road and you forget to write down the \nmileage and you get to the end of the **** and you get \nout of the car and you get into the station and you \nforget to write the mileage, how do you get the mileage \nfor the car here? How do you, I mean how do you \nguesstimate it if you didn't look at the odom, odometer? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Maybe I went out there and, uh, \nlooked, physically looked at the ending mileage or maybe \nI used an old template - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - with that mileage on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So this could be an old template or \nit could be partially correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes, for the fifth time. \n95 \n1 \n3 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Partially correct from one to the \nother? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: For the sixth time, just to \nLUIS CASILLAS: For the - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: ® add that for you. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - sixth time. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay, okay. So I'm showing you an \novertime slip or a DAR or rather, for, dated \nNovember 30th, 2013 from 1500 to 2300 hours and as you can \nsee, same rules apply. This was $50.00, 400 and 400, \nthis was a continuation of yours. So, um, looking at \nyour vehicle, it shows Unit 570 and the mileage start was \n87,175 and mileage end 87,187. Can you tell me if that's \nan accurate mileage total? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, probably not. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Probably? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Probably not, I, I would have to, \nI'm not good with math but if I add up the 15 to the 80, \nno, probably not. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So what should it be? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Um, uh, I don't have a calculator \nand I, probably a little more than 15. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. I'm gonna give you a piece \nof paper and I'd like you to make that determination and \n96 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ndo the calculation. There you go. Do you have a pen? \nLUIS CASILLAS: And can I borrow yours? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Yes, you may. \nLUIS CASILLAS: So, um, that would be 87, uh, minus, \nuh, uh, so that's ****, that would be, uh, 62 miles. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Would it? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, according to my math. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Make sure you're writing \ndown the numbers right. So it's 87,1 - \nLUIS CASILLAS: 187. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - 87 is the ending mileage. The \nbeginning mileage is 87,175, you have 125, I think, \nthere. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Oh, it's 175, I'm sorry. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So actually it, that should - \nLUIS CASILLAS: 12. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - be 12, correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: 12. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So can you recall \nspecifically why this mileage was not 15 or how you \nchanged those miles on **** \nLUIS CASILLAS: Um - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - if I ****. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - no, I can't recall. Um, I might \nhave made a mistake just like the mistake I made when I \n97 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ntried to do the math problem. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Yeah, okay. So then let's look at \nyour previous one for, this is Unit 570. It's a Ford \nCrown Victoria. This is Unit 570, a Ford Crown Victoria \nand if you'd notice that this was 87,000 and this is \n137,000, how might you, um, figure out why those two are \nso different in the same month? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No. Probably, uh, a template, a \nmistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go to the \nnext one. Okay, so 3, this is 11/8, I get ****. \nOkay, \nso this is going back. I missed a date in between here. \nThis is November 8th, 2013 from 1500 to 1900. It's \n4 hours. It's yours. It shows you driving Unit 570 with \na mileage of 137,859, 137,879, 20 miles. Can you tell me \nwhat happened there? It's 2 days after this one. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, it's, I just probably used the \nsame template or made a mistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: And I probably failed to properly \nfill that out correctly. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So you had three in November and \nthat's the order that they were in. So the first two \ntimes, you used the same mileage and the same mileage \ntotal, the same odometer readings and the third time, you \n98 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nused a different one with incorrect mileage ****. \nI'm \njust gonna show you your overtime slips. So on, um, \nNovember 6th, 2013, is that your signature on this \novertime slip that shows you used Stone Garden for \n4 hours? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay and it, were you signing that, \num, that it was required and accurate? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And on November 8th, 2013, \nsame question. Is that your signature on that document? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: That's not your signature? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Is, 'cause that's Orozco's, you're \nexactly right. Is that your signature? Thank you. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And are you certifying that \nyou worked the 4 hours and it's a, uh - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - required and accurate? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's what is says on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And then on November 30th, \n2013, same question. I'm gonna try to point to the right \none, this one right here and did you, um, sign that? \n99 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes, I did. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And is that 8 hours of overtime \nthat you're certifying is correct and accurate? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm, that's what I says. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Required and accurate. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And the date is 11/30? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Okay. One down. December \nis a big month, why? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Christmas. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Probably. Okay. I am showing a \ndocument, it's a daily activity report Stone Garden for \nand this is in handwriting L. Casillas - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - uh, $150.00, 350 and that looks \nlike, is that your writing as well on the narrative? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes, it is. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So, um, can you read for me \n'cause it's upside down, the mileage start and the \nmileage ending? \nLUIS CASILLAS: It reads, uh, Crown Vic, 580, start \n59,975, ending of 59,982, total mileage of 7 miles. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Is, is that correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, it's, I don't think it's \n100 \n1 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ncorrect. I'm obviously been making a lot of mistakes on \nthese in 2, in 2013. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay, so 59,982 minus 59,975, you \nhad been correct that time. And when you work overtime, \ndo you sometimes use the same car on your overtime \nshifts? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, sometimes and sometimes we do \nand sometimes we don't. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Do you see your name \nanywhere on this list? Do you know what this is list is, \nby the way, I'm sorry, I'm **** you. \nLUIS CASILLAS: It is a, uh, list that they keep in \ndispatch. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And what is it? \nLUIS CASILLAS: It's a list of the officer's names \nwith the unit numbers - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - and mileage. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So I'm gonna direct your \nattention to this dated sheet and it's called 25HH - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - is, starts at 12/1 and it goes \nthrough 12/5, so do you see, you're looking at 12/4 in \nfront of you, do you see your name anywhere on 12/4? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, yes, I do. \n101 \n1 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And what does it say? \nLUIS CASILLAS: It says Unit 580 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - and a start of 59,935. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And what does it say to the \nright of that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, 12/4. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: No, to the right of that. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Oh, I'm sorry. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Your right of that. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Oh - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Your right. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - 580. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: 5, I'm sorry, okay. What does it \nsay there? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, I, I, 59 or, I, I can't - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Could that - \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n* * * * \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - be an SG? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Oh, Stone Garden, SG. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah, that could be SG, Stone - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So is - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - Garden. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - the mileage same there as it is \n102 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nthere? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No, it is not. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. This is handwritten so \ntemplate may be out of the question but you have to tell \nme that. So how can you explain this being different \nthan this? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I might have made a mistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So it's another - \nLUIS CASILLAS: That - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - time that you might have made a \nmistake? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah, that's correct. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Four overtime slips in a row. \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's correct in - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - 2013. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: In 2013, okay. As a supervisor, \nwould you be concerned if any of your employees had any \nreport like a police report or any report that had you \nconsistently made mistakes on? Would that ever concern \nyou? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, I haven't got to that level yet. \nI'm not, I, maybe that's why I'm not a supervisor. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So that doesn't bother you? \nDoes that bother you? \n103 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's, it's a mistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: And I'm sure if they looked at \neveryone's, uh, Stone Garden sheets, there would be \nmillions of - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Well - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - mistakes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - we're not talking about everyone, \nright? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No, ****. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Right now, we're talking about you. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay, good. Okay. So that was \n12/4. Okay, 12/5. I'm gonna show you a DAR for 12/5. \nUm, is this one your DAR? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, that's what, my name is on \nthere. Yeah. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Yeah. \nLUIS CASILLAS: It sure is. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And is that your writing in the - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - narrative? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's mine. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So that's the entire DAR is yours? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm, it looks like it. \n104 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4\n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So what vehicle were you \ndriving? \nLUIS CASILLAS: 571. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And can you tell me what's its \nmileage start and mileage end? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No mileage. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And can you tell me what's in \nmileage total? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No mileage. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And can you explain to me why that \nand how that might happen? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, I didn't put it on, I failed \nto put the mileage down there. I half-assed it, as we \ncall it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. But you put a line through \nthere, so you know you did that. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Is that a yes? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. I'd also like you to take a \nlook at your date and time you worked. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Okay. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So the date, can you read that out \nto me? \nLUIS CASILLAS: 12/5/13. \n105 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And the time? \nLUIS CASILLAS: 13, what appears to be 19. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And how many hours is that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Hmm, I don't, that would be 13 to \n19, that's 6. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. How many hours does it say \nthat you worked? \nLUIS CASILLAS: 4 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Is that an accurate amount? \nIs that an accurate amount? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, that's what is says on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: It looks like it could be a mistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So another mistake. I'm gonna ask \nyou to look at your overtime slip and tell me how many \nhours you worked that day and what you submitted for. \nLUIS CASILLAS: 4 hours. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So which one do you think is \nthe accurate one, the date and time, the time and hours, \n* * * * \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, it's - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - **** \nLUIS CASILLAS: - here's the - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - and hours. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - there's some mistakes but I can, \n106 \n1 \n3 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nuh, I made a mistake. Well, I didn't, I didn't write \nthat 12/5/13. That's not my writing. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So you left it blank? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I might have left, left it blank, \nsomeone must have filled it in. You can clearly see how \nI do my 5s a lot different than I do. I don't know. \nLook how I do my 5. It doesn't look like, it doesn't \nappear to look like my writing, but my name is on there. \nOTHER SPEAKER: So it\nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nOTHER SPEAKER: - probably from your writing then it \nlooks like the 4 hours is the correct amount for \novertime. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: This is, so, um, extrapolating that \nout, so you failed to, uh, also complete the appropriate \ndate and hours, is that - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - correct? Okay. \nOTHER SPEAKER: So you shorted yourself 2 hours of \novertime, essentially. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: If in fact your timecard shows \nthat's correct. \nLUIS CASILLAS: I don't know what my timecard - \n107 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - says. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Uh, well, you can track already \nit's happened **** time **** here 12/6. Okay, so I'm \nshowing you a DAR for 12/6/2013 and would you please tell \nme if that is your DAR? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, yes, it is. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And did you fill out the operations \nLUIS CASILLAS: Date. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - information there? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I filled, it looks like I filled \nsome of it out. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: What part of it did you fill out? \nLUIS CASILLAS: It looks like my name, the 4 hours, \nthe rate, the cost. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And can you tell me what you \nfilled out as it relates to vehicle? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, Crown Vic, 580. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And did you fill out the mileage \nstart date? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, no, I did not. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Did you fill out the mileage end \ndate? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, no, I did not. \n108 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. I'm showing you another \nmileage log. It's called 26B. I'd like you to see if \nyou can see your name anywhere on that. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes, I do. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Do you see it for December 6th\nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes, I do. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Could you tell me what it says? \nLUIS CASILLAS: It says, uh, my name, the unit, 571, \nand it's, it has a start mileage of, uh, 85,900. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And can you tell me what you were \nworking that date or what it says to the right - \nLUIS CASILLAS: It - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - of that. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - it appears SG Stone Garden. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Can you explain how on your \nDAR it says you're at 58, in 580 and how you're in 571 \nwhen you log on? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah, I made a mistake, probably. \nUm, so once again, some sloppy, not paying attention, uh, \nthe way I filled out my DAR. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. The next DAR is dated \n12/14/2013. I'm gonna show it to you. It has your name \non it. Um, could you, uh, tell me, uh, what, if that's \nyour DAR? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That is my DAR. It's - \n109 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: ® got my name on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Can you tell me, um, what \nthe vehicle is and the mileage and the mileage total? \nLUIS CASILLAS: It says Vehicle 582, Crown Vic, \nstart of, uh, 97,000 and ending of 97,011. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And so does that look like \nthe right mileage? \nLUIS CASILLAS: 11 miles. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Mm hmm. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, it's, that's what's on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And I'm gonna show you DAR \nfor 12/15/2013. Can you review that and tell me if that \none is yours? \nLUIS CASILLAS: It's got my name on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: And, uh, it says 582 and it's got \n97,011 with a ending of 97,027. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So based on that, can you \ntell me how those numbers were placed in there? So this \nwas before this, so did you just change cars and, or stay \nin the same car and do overtime or how did that happen, \ndo you know? Do you recall? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I don't recall. I'm sure I made a \nmistake. I don't recall. It's been over a year. \n110 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Which car was that, 582? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Can you identify on this mileage \nlog any car named 582 anybody driven? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Hmm, it looks like Officer Frasier \nwas driving 582. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay and what was the mileage for \nOfficer Frasier's car on 12/15? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, 85,765. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And was that before or after 12/14? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, according to hat, it's 12/14 - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - on the - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - so - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - the logbook there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - so is that consistent with the \nmileage that you had there? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, 582, no, not for 582. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And so can you tell me if \nyour 12/15 is consistent with, uh, Frasier's mileage for \nthat date? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Hmm, it doesn't look like it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So can you tell me how this \nmight be that their mileage is 85,765 and your miles are \nin the 97,000 and consecutive to each other? \n111 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, all I can say, it's another \nmistake on the template. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So you used a template and \nyou made a mistake on the template? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Well, we, I, I made mistakes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: I improperly filled out the, uh, \nDAR. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So how is it that you improperly \nfilled it out when you started out at 97,000 and went \n97,011 and then started out at the next one exactly right \nafter that at 97,011 to 97,027 is immediately following \nit, how is it a mistake? \nLUIS CASILLAS: A mistake or a guess or I \nguesstimated, I don't, I couldn't tell you. I cannot \nrecall that specific date how it happened. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: But it's obviously a mistake that I \nmade on there filling it out. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So you're saying none of it's \nintentional? \nLUIS CASILLAS: None of it is intentional. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So how is it you came from 97,000 \nto 97,011 and the very next one being 97,011 to 97,027? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I made a mistake. It wasn't \n112 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nintentional. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So that's what you're gonna \nsay that was, a mistake. You can say it one more time \nbut I'm giving you a chance\nOTHER SPEAKER: Well, I'm - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - to tell - \nOTHER SPEAKER: - I'm curious - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \n****. \nOTHER SPEAKER: - to, I have a question. I'm \ncurious about what, is there a benefit derived from \nhaving a mileage be different from what it's supposed to \nor if you made, if you intentionally changed the mileage? \nI mean what benefit would that achieve? I'm just \ncurious. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Well, can you tell me what benefit \nyou might achieve from changing that mileage? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I, those DARs were, the way that we \nfilled 'em out were always, uh, we were always told and \nit was always common practice just to put your name on \nthere and fill it out the best you could and, uh, it's \nobvious that I made a bunch of mistakes on there. \nOTHER SPEAKER: But you didn't receive like mon, \nlike a mileage reimbursement or anything like that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: No, no. \nOTHER SPEAKER: Okay. \n113 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And the next one is, okay, \nso we looked at 12/15. Let's look at 12/16. 12/16, 1300 \nto 0100, is that your mileage? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's my name. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And is that your, what \nvehicle are you driving at that point? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, on the sheet, it states 582, \nCrown Victoria. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And what is the mileage on \nthat? \nLUIS CASILLAS: 9,110. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: 91,110\nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - to 91,120, correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's correct. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Is that consistent with the \nmileage 2 days earlier at 97,000? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, no, it doesn't look like it is. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Can you explain that, that \ndifference? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Other than I made a mistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: I improperly filled it out. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So I'm, I am actually a bit \ncurious, how is it that you would make a mistake on this \n114 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nbut on your, when you signed in on log, like you did on \nwhatever that 570, why it was different? Why didn't you \ntake the mileage from what you signed on and put it onto \nyour - \nLUIS CASILLAS: I, I couldn't - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - DA\nLUIS CASILLAS: - tell you. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: \nR? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I couldn't tell you. I can't, I \ncan't pinpoint that day in 2013 - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - why I did that other than it's an \nobvious mistake that I made and, uh. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So I'm gonna show you \nanother DAR the day following the last one, December 17th, \nand can you show me, tell me the vehicle number, the \nstart and the end date and how - \nLUIS CASILLAS: It looks - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - miles? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - like it's, it looks like it's 582 \nand it looks like it's another template that it used and, \nuh, the mileage is, uh, 91,120 and 91,123. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So the previous one was 91,110 to \n91,120 and then the next one follows on 91,120 to 91,123? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \n115 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Is that a yes? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's a yes. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So if you're using a \ntemplate, how is it that it either doesn't repeat or it's \nnumbers similar to some other one? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I made a mistake filling it out. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So the follow on is a mistake? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's a mistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So it was not intentional, is that \ncorrect? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's, not to my, I mean I can't go \nback to 2013 on that day and give you an answer of why I \ndid it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So I'm, we're going now to \nDecember 19th, 2013. First off is, you can see on here it \nsays date should be 12/19 and you have in here 10/8, 9, \num, 12/18 from 1500 to 2300. So could you give me the \nunit you're driving and the mileage start and mileage \nend? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Unit 570, start of 87,187, 87,193. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And do you remember the last times \nyou were driving, uh, Unit 570 what the mileage was? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, no, I do not. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So let's pull those back out \nso you can go back over those, give you an opportunity to \n116 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nexplain that. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n* * * * \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: \n**** this one. \nOTHER SPEAKER: All right, yeah, sure. Can we take \na break? \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Sure. We're gonna take a break and \nit's now 12:10. We're going to pause ****. \nOkay, we're \nback on tape and it's now 12:15. Okay, so we were \nlooking at your, uh, December 18th, which we later \ndetermined December 19th from 1500 to 2300 hours, 4 hours \nof overtime and we were looking at Unit No. 570, your \nmileage was 87,187 to 87,193 with the mileage total of \n10. Could you explain the mileage total? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, no, I mean it's, uh, a mistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: It looks like the mileage is off \nthere. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So when you look at the \nmileage start and mileage end on the previous ones that \nyou had, was it consistent with those in any way? So I'm \nshowing you the ones in November, the mileage start and \nmileage end being 137,000 twice then, uh, it's ****. \nThen 87,175 to 87,187 being November 30th. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yeah, it looks like the, uh, I made \n117 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \na mistake on the, uh, mileage there and on the, and the \ntotaling the miles. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So, uh, are there any other \nconcerns that you might have about the mileage start and \nmileage end date considering that on the mileage end date \non December 30th, you had 87,187 as the mileage end and \nthen the mileage start on December 19th was 87,187. \nLUIS CASILLAS: No, just a mistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: A mistake. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Poor recordkeeping. I can't, once \nagain, I can't recall that day in 2013. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Um, can you tell me if on, \nthis is Unit 570, if on this **** I put it on upside \ndown, 570, if anyone else drove Unit 570 in December. \nLUIS CASILLAS: It looks like, uh, Victor Flores \ndid. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And could you tell me what \nhis unit, uh, I mean what the mileage was when he logged \nLUIS CASILLAS: 8 - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - on? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - 7,342, uh, let's see, 87,342, 7. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: That's 87,342, 7? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I'm looking at - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \n118 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: - 570, is that what - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So there is two times that - ooh, \nwhat was that - two times where Flores signed on with \nUnit 570, is that correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's what it - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - appears. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - both of them - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - one of 'em is a Stone Garden and \nthe other one is a Shift 3, so he signed on 87,335.4 and \nthen he later, in the same day, signed on at 8C - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - 7,342.73, so can you tell me how \nwas that he was signed on to that car the entire shifts, \ntwo shifts and you show 4 hours of Stone Garden overtime? \nLUIS CASILLAS: I can't tell you 'cause I don't \nremember that specific date in 2013, but I can tell you \nthat it looks like I made a mistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: So then now - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So this is \nLUIS CASILLAS: - my **** \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - just another - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - ****. \n119 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - mistake? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's correct. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And it was not intentional, is that \ncorrect? \nLUIS CASILLAS: It's a mistake, poor recordkeeping. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Mistake, poor recordkeeping, okay. \n30th **** November ones. Same routine \nNovember 20th, 2013, uh, what vehicle is that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: 570. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And is that your - \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's my name, L. Casillas. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay and what is the mileage on \nthat? \nLUIS CASILLAS: On there, it's got 87,210. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: 2 - \nLUIS CASILLAS: 10. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: 287 - \nLUIS CASILLAS: 87,210 and the ending is 87,218. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: For 8 miles, correct? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's what it's, uh, that's what - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nLUIS CASILLAS: - I put on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And can you reconcile how your \nmileage should be, could be that and the mileage the day \nbefore is higher? \n120 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: I couldn't tell you. I don't \nremember that date. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And how might you explain it? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Once again, it looks like have some, \nuh, poor recordkeeping skills. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Was it intentional? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Once again, I said I have poor \nrecordkeeping skills and I made a mistake. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Oh. Your next overtime shift, \nDecember 25th \n2013, I'm showing you, your DAR for that \nand that on the second page, uh, can you tell me what \nyour vehicle unit number is and what the mileage is? \nLUIS CASILLAS: 570. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And the mileage start and end? \nLUIS CASILLAS: 87,210, 87,218. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: How many miles is that? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, it says 8 on there. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Can you explain the fact that those \ntwo are the same from the same, two different dates? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, no, I can't explain other than I \nmade a mistake while filling them out. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Whoops. \nOTHER SPEAKER: I have a question. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Yes. \nOTHER SPEAKER: If my client doesn't have specific \n121 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n7 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nrecollection of a DAR and we're gonna continue to go \nthrough one day at a time and it's an issue of mileage \nbeing inaccurate, I just don't understand why we need to \ngo through every single one if his answer is it must be a \nmistake, inaccurate recordkeeping, whereas if he had some \nspecific recollection, I could see the value in going \nthrough every single one but I mean it just seems like \nthere's a trend that's emerging here and I just, I don't, \nI don't really see the value in going through every \nsingle - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nOTHER SPEAKER: - DAR. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: So precisely, there is a trend. \nOTHER SPEAKER: Right. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: That's clear. \nOTHER SPEAKER: Right. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Um, we're pretty much to another \nsection of, uh, issues that I - \nOTHER SPEAKER: Okay. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - have. \nOTHER SPEAKER: Okay. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And so the 25th was, well, okay, so \nlet me ask you this question. So here I am, if I don't \nask you this and every time you say you don't remember, \nthe one time I don't ask you then the defense is, you \n122 \n1 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \ndidn't ask him on that date. Okay, so, um, if I'm, if on \nrecord you want to tell me you don't remember anything \nfrom back there and you don't remember any reason why you \nmight have made those, um, documentations and you want to \nsay for all of these, I have no personal recollection, it \nmust have been a mistake, I'll take that and we won't go \nany further, but that's based on all of them and there \nare gonna be questions on every one of 'em. And so \nthat's, that's my question to you, either I go through \nthis all or you say, I don't remember any of 'em and, uh, \nyou **** probably shouldn't ask me anymore, but I'm not \ngonna take that on myself to do that. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Oh, I, you're asking me - \nOTHER SPEAKER: Do you want - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - I don't - \nOTHER SPEAKER: - to, do you want to take a break \nand talk about it? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Sure. \nOTHER SPEAKER: Okay. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. Let's take a break and it is \nnow 12:24. Okay. It's not 12:31 and we're back on tape. \nYou had some time to talk so how are we gonna proceed? \nOTHER SPEAKER: Well, basically, um, my client feels \nthat he doesn't have any indirect, independent \nrecollection of any of these DARs in 2013 and if there \n123 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nare inaccurate, inaccuracies, his stance is that it was \nan inadvertent mistake on his part and sloppy rec, \nrecordkeeping and in no way was it done intentionally, \num, or fraudulently. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \nOTHER SPEAKER: Um\nBETTY KELEPECZ: So what if we go into 2014, are you \ngonna have that, I mean I'm, I have things up through \nJune 30th, 2014, is that gonna be the similar response? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's gonna be the, the, uh, the \nsame response. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So I'm gonna get on record \nthat you, you believe there is no, urn, need on my part to \ncontinue to go through, it's just gonna be the same \nanswer over and over again? \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's correct. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. So I have two specific, two \nor three specific questions to ask you and, uh, then we \nwill go into the allegation questions and, um, finish up \nwith the final questions and we should be done before \n1:00, okay. So let's go to a couple specific questions \nand I'm sorry if I have to go that ****, but I have to, \nhere it is. Here is my folder, so let's go to April, so \nthat January, here we go. Okay. Earlier, we talked \nabout the, um, no more using furloughs, uh, Stone Garden \n124 \n1 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nfor furlough. I'm gonna show you a overtime slip dated \nApril 10th, 2014 and is that your overtime slip right \nthere? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes, it is. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And this is less than a year \nago. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Mm hmm. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And, and can you tell, see right \nthere where it says furlough, is that your writing? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Yes, it is. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And it says probation \nsweeps, is that correct - \nLUIS CASILLAS: That's - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - HSI and probation? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - that's what it says. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And Stone Garden. Um, I'd like you \nto take a look at the supervisor's signature. Can you \ntell me, um, under what circumstances that might have, \nnot have been signed again - \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - 'cause we kind of went through \nsome of that, but. \nLUIS CASILLAS: Have, I have no clue why he wouldn't \nhave signed, someone \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. \n125 \n1 \n3 \n4 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nLUIS CASILLAS: - would have signed it. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Do you remember, um, putting in for \nfurlough -® \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - days - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - no, I do not, I - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - for - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - don't - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - Stone - \nLUIS CASILLAS: - re - \nBETTY KELEPECZ: - Garden? \nLUIS CASILLAS: - I don't remember that specific \nday, no. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay. And were there any times \nthat you ever worked with any, anyone while you were \nworking, in other words, two in a car during Stone \nGarden? \nLUIS CASILLAS: At times. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: And can you recall any specific \ncircumstances when that did occur? \nLUIS CASILLAS: Uh, oftentimes, if they ran out of \ncars with the, uh, if some of the vehicles didn't work \nand there wasn't enough cars for everyone, we would \ndouble up, at times. \nBETTY KELEPECZ: Okay.

At that meeting, the \npanel voted to recommend the officers not be returned to duty until completion of their required \ndebriefs and voluntary interviews with ISD and the District Attorney Office’s Independent \nInvestigations Bureau (IIB). \n \nOn Friday September 27, the Return to Duty panel reconvened to discuss whether it was appropriate \nfor the involved officers to return to their regular duty assignments.  The panel was comprised of the \nfollowing members: \n \n• Acting Assistant Chief Peter Walsh (Chair) – Chief of Staff \n• Acting Deputy Chief Eric Vintero – Field Operations \n• Acting Captain Daniel Manning – Tenderloin Station \n• Acting Captain Timothy O’Connor – Risk Management Office \n• Lieutenant Lisa Springer – Internal Affairs Division \n• Sergeant Art Howard – Behavioral Science Unit \n \nAlso present were ISD Sergeant Yukio Oshita, ISD Sergeant Rodney Fitzpatrick, and Administration \nBureau Sergeant Eric Pan. \n  \nCITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO \n \nPOLICE DEPARTMENT \n \nHEADQUARTERS \n \n1245 3RD Street \n \nSan Francisco, California  94158 \nLONDON N.

The briefing was an overview of the incident discussing the currently known facts and \nevidence related to this incident.  Sergeant Oshita and Sergeant Fitzpatrick reported that the involved \nofficers completed their voluntary interviews with ISD and the District Attorney Office’s Independent \nInvestigations Bureau (IIB) on September 18, 2024.   \n \nInternal Affairs Division (IAD):  Lieutenant Springer reported the involved officers successfully \ncompleted their post-discharge Range Debriefs and Force Options Refresher on September 25, 2024.   \n \nBehavioral Science Unit (BSU):  Sergeant Howard reported that each of the involved officers were \ndebriefed by the Behavioral Science Unit on September 16, 2024.  \n \n. \n \nTenderloin Station Acting Captain Manning reported that he was in contact with each of the involved \nofficers, \n  Each officer has been \nplaced on administrative duty pending their return to full duty. \n \nThe panel noted that the involved officers had completed all necessary debriefs required prior to \nreturning to duty after involvement in an OIS.  After hearing the presentations and ensuing discussion, \nthe panel unanimously recommended that Officer Phong Nguyen #69, Officer Colin Ryan #1538, and \nOfficer Bartholomew Sullivan #6 be returned to their regular duty assignment.   \n \nMy decision whether to return these officers to duty, including the aforementioned mandatory \ndebriefings and factors supporting the decision, is scheduled for presentation to the Police \nCommission in closed session on October 2, 2024.

File #23-0185 \nL.B.P.D. File #23-26278\nDATE: \nOctober 3, 2023 \nThe Justice System Integrity Division of the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office has \ncompleted its review of the May 30, 2023, non-fatal shooting of Mario Najara (Najara) by Long \nBeach Police Department (LBPD) Officer Edmund Moscoso.  We conclude that the officer acted \nlawfully to apprehend a fleeing felon to prevent death or serious bodily injury. \nThe District Attorney’s Command Center was notified of the shooting at approximately 2:22 p.m., \non May 30, 2023.  The District Attorney Response Team (DART) responded to the location and \nwas given a briefing regarding the circumstances surrounding the shooting and a walk-through of \nthe scene. \nThe following analysis is based on investigative reports, audio recordings, crime scene diagrams \nand sketches, photographic and video evidence, including body worn camera video, and witness \nstatements submitted by LBPD Detective Oscar Valenzuela on August 23, 2023.  A voluntary \nstatement provided by Moscoso was considered as part of this analysis. \nFACTUAL ANALYSIS \nAssaults by Najara \n. and \nJust before noon on May 30, 2023, \n and \n were walking north on Park \nAvenue along the sidewalk.  They had just gotten coffee and eaten breakfast, and they were on \ntheir way home.  According to \n when she and \n were walking alongside Livingston \nPark, Najara “just appeared” either from across the street or to her side.  He walked up and said, \n“Who are you,” or “Where are you from?”  \n tried to wave Najara off and ignore him. \nNajara hit \n knocking him down, and immediately hit \n in the face.  \n and \n made their way closer to the entrance of the park at the corner of Park Avenue and \n2 \nLivingston Drive to get away from Najara. \n saw that there were people in the park, \nincluding children playing in the playground.  When \n and \n arrived at the corner \npark entrance, Najara was still pursuing them and trying to fight \n wanted to get \naway to safety, so she went into the park to use the wall between the park and the sidewalk as a \nbarrier between her and \n and Najara.  At this time, \n saw Najara pull something \nsilver out of his waist area, which she believed could have been a pocketknife.  \n was not \nsure if Najara had that object in his hand the entire time he was fighting with her and \nOnce \n and \n were inside the park, Najara attempted to follow.  To dissuade Najara, \n threw her coffee cup at him and attempted to shut the park gate, but it did not fully close.  \n ran across the park with \n and lost track of Najara.  She did not see what Najara \ndid in the park, as she hopped another fence to get further away.  \n and \n made their \nway to the Wells Fargo Bank at the corner of Livingston Drive and Second Street. \n told \npeople inside the bank to call the police and lock the door.  \n and \n waited in the \nbank and were ultimately treated by fire department personnel for their injuries. \n suffered \na laceration to her right neck below her jawline. \n suffered a laceration to his face just \nabove his right eye.  \n, his daughter \n, and grandsons \n and \n, were playing together at \nLivingston Park.  \n was holding two-month-old \n and two-year-old \n was playing \nwith his grandfather on the slides. \n noticed a man and woman, likely \n and \nrunning toward the end of the park and hopping over a fence.  One of the two had a cut to the \nneck that was bleeding.  \n heard a woman say, “We’re gonna get out of here.”  \n looked \nat the entrance of the park and saw a “crazy guy,” referring to Najara, approaching her father and \n  Najara said to \n “Where the fuck you from?” and used a racial slur.  \n called out \nto \n that they needed to leave.  \n slowly stood up and picked up \n but fell onto his \nback.  \n managed to run toward \n but while \n was on his back, Najara began to \nrepeatedly stab \n with a “long and skinny knife.”  After Najara stabbed \n approximately \nten times, another lady yelled at Najara to stop, diverting his attention, which provided \n the \nopportunity to get up and flee the park with \n and her children.   \n3 \nFigure 1:  Livingston Park playground (B); Evidence collected at scene (A and C). \n iPhone was taken during the incident.  The phone was later recovered from Najara after \nhe was taken into custody.  \n suffered multiple wounds to his face, legs, and right forearm, \nbut did not require hospitalization. \n had a visible contusion to his forehead and a cut to his \nlip believed to be the result of having been dropped as Najara attacked \n911 Caller \nAt 11:54:51 (11:54 a.m. and 51 seconds), the first of several 9-1-1 calls was made to LBPD.  A \nfemale caller reported a “guy attacking people at Livingston Park” and provided a narration of \nNajara’s actions.  The caller said Najara had a knife, that people confronted him in the park, and \nNajara walked away.  The caller said Najara threatened more people and had “beat up one guy” \nand was walking toward Second Street.  The caller said she saw Najara follow a couple into the \npark at first, likely referring to \n and \n Najara stabbed another man, likely referring \nto \n  The caller said Najara was making a right turn onto Second Street going toward the \nSuper Mex restaurant located on the east side of Second Street.  The caller exclaimed, “Oh my \nGod! He’s punching random people! ... Where are the cops?”  After reporting that Najara was \nnear Roycroft Avenue, right in front of Super Mex, she yelled, “Oh my God, he just stabbed \nsomebody! … We need an ambulance!  Hold this guy’s throat!” \nThe person the 9-1-1 caller saw being stabbed was \n . \n was waiting in front of \nthe Super Mex restaurant after requesting a job application from the manager.  As \n stood \nnear the front of the restaurant on the sidewalk, Najara approached from the south and, without \nsaying a word, swung his right fist, which was holding a screwdriver, into \n neck.  \n turned and looked at Najara, who, after initially walking away, came back toward \n  Surveillance video shows Najara visibly upset at \n and kicking a sign over \n4 \nbefore continuing northbound on Second Street toward the Wells Fargo Bank. \n suffered \na puncture wound to his neck but did not require stitching or surgery.   \nFigure 2:  Surveillance video stills from Super Mex show Najara stabbing \n in the neck.  In video still (D), \nNajara attempts to re-engage with \n but continues walking north on Second Street shortly thereafter. \nFigure 3:  Overhead depiction of approximate locations of assaults of \n and \n (1), \n (2), and \n(3), and approximate location of officer-involved shooting (4). \nLBPD Responds \nTimeline of Radio Broadcasts \nAs the events described above unfolded, 9-1-1 callers were contacting LBPD, and dispatchers \nwere transmitting updates over the radio, which was being broadcast to responding officers, \nincluding Officer Edmund Moscoso.  Below is a timeline of these radio transmissions from \nLBPD.  From the time of the first 9-1-1 call to the officer-involved shooting, less than eight \nminutes elapsed. \n5 \nTime \nEvent Reported by Dispatcher Over Radio \n11:55:46\nCalling party (CP) says a subject is attacking people in the park, “5150 violent”1 \n11:56:16\nCP describes the subject as a male Hispanic with a knife\n11:56:46\nCP says subject is stabbing several people at the park\n11:57:11\nCP says subject leaving park, going westbound on Park toward Second Street \n11:57:33\nSubject is walking on sidewalk, has hands in his pocket\n11:57:54\nAnother CP reports a 415 fight2 with a subject who is yelling\n11:58:05\nCP reports subject stabbed three people\n11:58:42\nCP lost sight of subject \n11:58:50\nBattery victims report that they came to Wells Fargo and were not stabbed, but the \nsubject had something in his hand \n11:59:37\nCP says the subject is now on Second Street walking toward Super Mex restaurant\n11:59:49\nCP says the subject is punching random people now \n12:00:18\nCP reports saw subject hit male Asian with wife and child, ran to car and left \n12:01:26\nDispatch log references victim at Second Street and Roycroft, referring to victim at \nSuper Mex with a stab wound to neck\n12:00:27\nCP says the subject just stabbed someone else and they need an ambulance\n12:02:13\nDispatcher advises there is a stabbing victim at Second Street and Roycroft Avenue \n12:02:19\nCP advises subject attacked three people, a couple, and an older male with kids\n12:03:18\nCP advises saw another stabbing at Super Mex \n12:03:22\nOfficer-involved shooting occurs \nOfficer-Involved Shooting \nOfficer Ruben Navarro was the first officer to encounter Najara.  Najara was walking north on \nSecond Street approaching the Wells Fargo Bank as Navarro exited his patrol vehicle.  \nAccording to Navarro’s body worn video, at 12:01:00, Navarro radioed that the subject “says he \nwants to be shot, he won’t put it down,” referring to the screwdriver.  Navarro advised dispatch \nto call Wells Fargo Bank to tell the employees to lock the door to the bank.  Najara entered the \nWells Fargo courtyard at 12:01:14, and Navarro radioed, “Next unit, can you get a 40?” referring \nto a less-than-lethal shotgun.  Najara threw a trash can lid at Navarro, from behind a gate in the \nWells Fargo Bank courtyard.  Najara continued to walk away from Navarro, yelling obscenities \nand encouraging Navarro to “do it,” meaning to shoot him.  Najara walked past a man in the \nWells Fargo parking lot who told Navarro, “He’s got something in his hand.”  Najara repeatedly \nasked Navarro to shoot him.  At 12:01:55, Navarro radioed, “He has that knife in his right \nhand… [the subject is] headed towards Livingston.”   \n1 “5150” refers to Welfare and Institutions Code § 5150 and is sometimes used by law enforcement personnel when \nspeaking to indicate someone may be suffering from a mental health disorder. \n2 “415” refers to Penal Code § 415, disturbing the peace. \n6 \nNajara exited the Wells Fargo parking lot and walked westbound toward the corner of Livingston \nDrive and Quincy Avenue.  Navarro continued to give repeated orders to Najara to get on the \nground.  In the two minutes and 19 seconds from when Navarro first contacted Najara until the \nofficer-involved shooting, Navarro told Najara to get on the ground eight times.  At 12:02:23, \nNavarro radioed to report that Najara was walking northbound on Quincy Avenue.   \nAt 12:02:30, Moscoso arrived in his patrol vehicle and drew his pistol.  Najara immediately \nstopped, turned toward Moscoso, and yelled, “Shoot mother fucker!”  Moscoso’s body worn \nvideo shows Najara held the screwdriver in his right hand shortly after Najara made this \nstatement.  Moscoso told Officer Jeffrey Craver, who had arrived at approximately the same time \nas Moscoso, to prepare the “40 now,” three times, referring to a 40 mm less-than-lethal shotgun. \nFigure 4:  Still frame and close-up from Moscoso's body worn video depicting \nNajara holding a screwdriver in his right hand. \nMoscoso instructed Najara to get on the ground twice, and to drop the weapon in his hand six \ntimes, in the span of 33 seconds from the time he exited his patrol vehicle until the officer-\ninvolved shooting occurred.  Najara refused and, before the less-than-lethal shotgun could be \nused by Craver, continued walking into the driveway of a residence located on East Livingston \nDrive.  This address is a two-story multi-unit residence with one unit upstairs and one on the \nground level.  A detached garage associated with the property is just north of the two-story \nbuilding, and a driveway leads from the garage onto Quincy Avenue (see Figure 7). \nMoscoso yelled, “Drop the knife, now!” but Najara walked between cars parked in the residence \ndriveway to a gate at the north side of the garage.  Moscoso continued to command Najara to \n7 \n“drop the knife,” and Najara continued to refuse as he arrived at the gate.  Najara reached to the \ntop of the gate with his right hand and opened the gate.3  Moscoso fired two rounds at Najara, \nstriking him one time in the upper left arm.   \nFigure 5:  Still frame from Navarro's body worn video showing Moscoso crouching and preparing to fire at Najara, \nwhose position is indicated by the yellow arrow. \nNajara had a single gunshot wound to the upper left arm that also penetrated his torso, \n.  LBPD officers rendered aid at the scene until the Long Beach Fire Department \narrived.  Najara was transported to a hospital where he was treated \n. \n.  A cell phone determined to belong to victim \n was recovered from Najara’s \npocket while he was detained.  A screwdriver that appeared to have blood on the handle was also \nlocated. \n3 In his report, discussed later, Moscoso wrote that Najara used his left hand to open the gate.  Body worn video \nappears to show Najara using his right hand to do so. \n8 \nFigure 6:  Screwdriver recovered from near Najara's position after officer-involved shooting. \nAfter the officer-involved shooting, a resident at the location, \n opened another gate \non the south side of the garage so officers could go around the back of the garage and contact \nNajara from the other side of the gate to the north of the garage.  At the time of the officer-\ninvolved shooting, as Najara was attempting to gain access to the property, three residents were \nhome in the two units located on East Livingston Drive.  \nFigure 7:  Overhead view of the scene of the officer-involved shooting.  From the approximate location of the gate \nto the north of the garage (A), a path depicted with yellow arrows shows a route to the doors of the two residences \n(B) and the metal gate to the south of the garage (C).\n9 \nInterview of Residents \n and \n heard a commotion outside her residence and looked outside her window.  She saw \nNajara “running” northbound on Quincy Avenue to her driveway.  She saw police officers \nfollowing behind who were ordering Najara to stop.  As Najara got to the pathway just north of \nher garage, the officers, who were behind her parked cars in the driveway, ordered Najara to \n“stop reaching,” and yelled, “Put your hands up!”  \n said Najara continued to disobey the \nofficers’ commands and reached for his waistband, after which she heard approximately three \ngunshots and saw Najara fall to the ground. \n was outside the residence in his yard when he saw officers running northbound on \nQuincy Avenue.  He could not see Najara, but heard the officers order Najara to stop, put his \nhands up, and “drop it,” followed by one officer saying, “Don’t do it!”  \n wife, \ntold him that Najara and the officers were in their driveway.  As \n walked toward the \ndriveway, he heard approximately two gunshots. \n saw Najara on the ground. \nStatement of Moscoso \nIn a report summarizing this incident, Moscoso described the events leading up to the officer-\ninvolved shooting.  Moscoso heard on his police radio that an officer already on scene (Navarro) \nwas with Najara and that Najara “still had the knife, and he was not putting it down and stated he \nwanted to be shot.”  Moscoso wrote that he knew the de-escalation tactics used by Navarro had \nbeen ineffective.  Moscoso indicated he knew Najara had assaulted several people and that he \nbelieved that the victims of these assaults could be gravely injured.  Moscoso believed Najara \nneeded to be immediately apprehended to prevent others from being assaulted and possibly \nkilled.  Moscoso did not know what residences were occupied as Najara walked northbound on \nQuincy Avenue.  However, he saw that there were two cars parked in the driveway in front of the \ngarage of the East Livingston Drive location.  Moscoso was concerned about pedestrians and, \nspecifically, the possibility that a resident was near the garage being approached by Najara.  As \nNajara put his left hand on a locking mechanism on the gate leading to the pathway north of the \ngarage at the residence, Moscoso yelled, “Don’t do it!”  Moscoso saw Craver next to him with \nthe less-than-lethal shotgun but did not believe Craver could see or effectively shoot Najara \nbecause of an SUV parked between Craver and Najara.  According to Moscoso, no other force \noptions were available, so he fired two rounds at Najara.   \nFiling of Criminal Complaint \nOn June 1, 2023, a felony complaint in case NA121989 charged Najara with two felony counts \nof assault by means likely to cause great bodily injury in violation of Penal Code § 245(a)(4) \nwith respect to \n and \n one count each of assault with a deadly weapon and robbery \nin violation of §§ 245(a)(1) and 211, respectively, with respect to \n and one count each of \nattempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon in violation of §§ 664/187(a) and 245(a)(1), \nrespectively, with respect to \n  A misdemeanor count of resisting, obstructing, or delaying \na peace officer in violation of § 148(a)(1) was also filed.  The case is currently pending. \n10 \nLEGAL ANALYSIS \nAny peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has \ncommitted a public offense may use objectively reasonable force to effect the arrest, to prevent \nescape, or to overcome resistance. Penal Code § 835a(b). \nA peace officer is justified in using deadly force upon another person when the officer \nreasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, that such force is necessary for \neither of the following reasons: (1) to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious \nbodily injury to the officer or to another person; or (2) to apprehend a fleeing person for any \nfelony that threatened or resulted in death or serious bodily injury, if the officer reasonably \nbelieves that the person will cause death or serious bodily injury to another unless immediately \napprehended.  Penal Code § 835a(c)(1)(A) & (B).   \nWhen using deadly force to apprehend a fleeing felon, an officer shall, where feasible, and prior \nto the use of force, make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace officer and to warn \nthat deadly force may be used, unless the officer has objectively reasonable grounds to believe \nthe person is aware of those facts.  Penal Code § 835a(c)(1)(B) \nIn assessing the totality of the circumstances, all facts known to or perceived by the peace officer \nat the time, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of deadly \nforce, is taken into consideration.  Penal Code § 835a(a)(4) & (e)(3).  The peace officer’s \ndecision to use force is not evaluated with the benefit of hindsight and shall account for \noccasions when officers may be forced to make quick judgments about using force.  Penal Code \n§ 835a(a)(4).\nThe evidence in this matter shows that prior to the officer-involved shooting, Najara committed \nnumerous violent attacks upon random, unsuspecting citizens.  The information regarding these \nattacks was broadcast to responding officers, who indicated they were aware that Najara had \nattacked numerous people and that there were multiple stabbing victims.  Officers also knew that \nNajara was still armed with the weapon he used during these stabbings.  The officers, upon \narrival, saw Najara in possession of the screwdriver.  Najara ignored numerous commands to \ndrop the screwdriver.  As he approached the driveway on Quincy Avenue for the two-story, two-\nunit apartment, Najara opened a gate that provided him access to a breezeway that would lead \nbehind the garage and ultimately to the entrances to the two residences on the property.  At the \ntime of this incident, three people were home in those residences.  There was a reasonable \npossibility that Najara would encounter more potential victims by accessing this private area.  \nMoscoso indicated he had observed parked cars in the driveway of the residence and was \nconcerned Najara would harm or kill someone based on his personal knowledge, via radio \nbroadcasts, of Najara’s random assaults in the minutes prior to his arrival. \nNajara demonstrated a willingness to commit random, unprovoked, life-threatening attacks on \nseveral people, and showed no intention of abiding by the commands of officers to stop his \nactions.  His response to the presence of the police officers was continued aggressive behavior, \nthrowing a trash can lid at Navarro and imploring multiple officers to shoot him as he proceeded \nto attempt to enter an occupied residential property.  Attempts to use less lethal options were \n11 \nineffective.  Najara refused to drop the screwdriver – the weapon he had used during his attack of \nfour civilians in the span of less than ten minutes – and did not relinquish it until he was shot by \nMoscoso. \nBased on the totality of the circumstances of Najara’s conduct before police arrived and his \nactions when confronted by the police, Moscoso could reasonably believe that the use of deadly \nforce was necessary to apprehend Najara, who had just committed multiple violent felonies \ncausing injuries to four separate victims, to prevent death or serious bodily injury to others. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, we find that Moscoso acted lawfully.",

(See Evidence Code §§ 210, 780, 1202).   \n \n \nPenal Code § 135.5 has expanded the nature of information that must be provided to a \npublic safety officer during any disciplinary proceeding.  It is now unlawful to conceal any relevant \nevidence during the disciplinary process.  Concealment would include knowingly not providing \nany relevant evidence.  \n \n \nSome information that may not have been relevant to you in making the decision to \ndiscipline my client, a public safety officer, is relevant to disproving the allegations or mitigating \nthe facts or the level of proposed discipline.

S01 Ruelas failed to obey our commands.\n5\n6\n7 JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF K9:\n8\n9 Based on the information I developed on the scene, I determined S01\n10 Ruelas was wanted for a felony warrant involving a firearm, had a\n11 prior history of assault with a deadly weapon, a gun, and resisting\n12 arrest. \n13\n14 Because S01 Ruelas was hiding in an unknown area, had access to\n15 unconventional weapons, was given multiple warnings to surrender\n16 peacefully, and was resisting arrest, I believed that S01 Ruelas\n17 posed an immediate threat to deputies on the scene and the public.\n18\n19 Based on the facts mentioned above, I determined that the use of K9\n20 Niner was within policy, and the use of K9 Niner would enhance\n21 officer safety significantly, increase the likelihood of locating and\n22 apprehension of the suspect. The use of K9 Niner would bring this\n23 incident to a quick resolution without endangering the public or\n24 searching deputies.\n25\n26 SCENE DESCRIPTION:\n27\n28 The area to be searched was a single-family home that was currently\n29 being renovated and had a detached garage that had been converted\n30 into three bedrooms.

Once the door was breached, I gave K9 Niner his search\n19 command. \n20\n21 K9 Niner made entry into the house through the kitchen door and began\n22 to search. In this portion of the house, it had a continuous open\n23 flow. The house was under construction with power tools, handheld\n24 tools, household items that could be used as unconventional tools\n25 that could cause harm to searching deputies. \n26\n27 As K9 Niner was searching west of the kitchen, which appeared to be a\n28 possible living room, he had a behavior change.

We continued our search of the residence and did not\n4 locate S01 Ruelas inside.\n5\n6 The QRF team exited the west sliding glass door and searched the\n7 remaining part of the backyard. There were multiple tool sheds,\n8 gardening tools, and other unconventional weapons that could be\n9 weaponized to hurt searching deputies and K9 Niner.

Once we returned to this portion of the house, K9 Niner\n14 immediately began to search. There was a hole in the floorboard where\n15 K9 Niner put his nose in. Niner took a deep breath and immediately\n16 began to dig into the floorboard with his front paws. I told the QRF\n17 team that S01 Ruelas was underneath the house. \n18\n19 We began to look for an entry point near where K9 Niner was searching\n20 for S01 Ruelas.

I would not have been able to\n6 remove the plywood without pulling it toward me.\n7\n8 It should be noted that there was no way for S01 Ruelas to have been\n9 able to go underneath both pieces of wood without the assistance of\n10 someone else. I believe S01 Ruelas had help getting underneath the\n11 floor to the crawl space from an unknown person on the property.

Based on S01\n18 Ruelas’ location, it was not feasible to use any other means of\n19 lesser force to effect the arrest.

As I closed the distance to K9\n6 Niner and S01 Ruelas, there were several times when my duty belt or\n7 uniform got stuck on a pipe, wire, or nail.

S01\n12 Ruelas was lying on his left hip. S01 Ruelas was using his right hand\n13 to grab the neck area of K9 Niner. S01 Ruelas was using his right\n14 hand to choke K9 Niner. S01 Ruelas continued to fight K9 Niner. He\n15 moved his right hand from the neck area and placed it on the bridge\n16 of K9 Niner's nose. S01 Ruelas used his right hand to push K9 Niner's\n17 face into the mud.

I read \nthe investigative memorandum written by Lt. Russell Greene in which he found the following \npotentially applicable penal code, department policy and personnel code violations: \n \n- \n- \n- \n- \n \n \n \n \n \n- \nNe\nda County MOU General Employees Unit 39, Subsection (B)(6) Causes for \nDiscipline \no f.)

Specifically, Correctional Officer Aguirre was allegedly involved in a domestic \nviolence incident within the City of Grass Valley.  Lt. Russell Greene was assigned to investigate \nthe incident and determine if there were any potential criminal or policy violations.  While \ninvestigating the reported incident, he became aware of some other concerns involving C.O. \nAguirre. \n \nThe original incident occurred on July 4, 2023, between C.O. Aguirre and her boyfriend,\n  Investigation proved their relationship qualifies under the domestic violence laws in the \nState of California.  On this evening, an uninvolved third party reported a male and female (later \nidentified as\n and Aguirre), were involved in some sort of physical violence.  Members of \nthe Grass Valley Police Department arrived on scene to investigate.  During this contact, Aguirre \nidentified herself as an employee of the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office. \n \nThe Grass Valley Police Department officers determined\nand Aguirre had been involved in \na mutual physical altercation.  In fact, this was verified not just through witness statements but \nalso a video recording made by the reporting party.  The video shows Aguirre slapping\nacross the face before\n did a “hip thrust” and took Aguirre to the ground.  The officers \ninterviewed both\n and Aguirre.  Both  lied and were adamant the argument had been verbal \nonly and nothing physical had happened. \n \nThe Grass Valley Police Department officers did not arrest either person, and ultimately decided \nto separate the\n and Aguirre for the evening.  The officers wrote a report which was \nforwarded to the Nevada County District Attorney’s Office for review.  The report indicated both \nparties were intoxicated but both declined to provide a breath sample.  As part of his investigation, \nLt. Greene sought input from the District Attorney’s Office for the disposition of this criminal case.  \nHis investigation revealed the D.A.’s Office elected to not pursue criminal charges against either \nparty. \n \nA second incident occurred while Lt. Greene was investigating the incident that occurred in Grass \nValley.  On July 22, 2023, deputies from the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office were summoned to \nAguirre’s residence in Nevada City.  The response was prompted by a neighbor calling for \nassistance after hearing a loud disturbance between a male and female.  After the deputies \narrived, they found Aguirre inside the residence with a head wound.  Aguirre was the only person \nhome when the deputies arrived.  She claimed to not know how her injuries occurred.  Aguirre \nwas transported to the hospital and deputies took an initial report. \n \nDetectives conducted follow-up in the days to come.  Despite their efforts, Aguirre claimed to have \nno recollection of how her head was injured when questioned by law enforcement.  However, \nAguirre sent C.O. Wall a Snapchat video while she was receiving treatment at the hospital that \nIA-2023-003 REVIEW AND FINDINGS \nCONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM \n4 | P a g e  \n \nsaid, \ndid a number on me.” \n did not confess to being involved in any type of \nphysical confrontation. \n \nLt. Greene’s investigation uncovered additional acts of misconduct / policy violations.  Prior to \ninterviewing Aguirre, he discovered the following: \n \n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n \nAs part of his investigation, Lt. Greene interviewed multiple co-workers and jail staff.  I noted some \ncommon themes as I read through his report.  Many co-workers said Aguirre was a good \nemployee,\n \nSeveral co-workers mentioned Aguirre would\n  In one \ninstance,\n \n \nAguirre’s co-workers mentioned\n  In \nfact, Aguirre admitted\n  Rumors made their way \naround the jail after \nwas arrested for domestic violence against Aguirre\n \nAguirre missed several weeks of work after this incident.  She returned to live with\n, despite \nseveral people offering her a place to stay.  One supervisor had taken time to speak with Aguirre, \noffered help and provided an EAP packet.  However, it seemed Aguirre was in denial of the \nsituation and declined assistance. \n \nSeveral co-workers knew Aguirre was living with\n.  At least one person (Correctional Officer \nHare) had heard rumors\n was facing criminal charges in another jurisdiction (and was \npossibly on probation).\n \nLt. Greene and Lt. Scales interviewed Aguirre on November 16, 2023.  Aguirre was accompanied \nby her representative.  I noted the following from her interview: \n \nIA-2023-003 REVIEW AND FINDINGS \nCONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM \n5 | P a g e  \n \n-\n \n \n-\n \no Aguirre admitted she knowingly lied to the Grass Valley Police officers regarding the \nphysical altercation. \n \n- \nAguirre admitted she had lived at her current address for one year. \no She moved into the house in November of 2022 \no Aguirre claimed ignorance on how to update her address, although she said she \nhad done it once before. \n- \nAguirre claimed she ended the dating relationship after the July 4, 2023, incident, although \nshe remained living with Alcorn because she had nowhere else to go. \n- \nAguirre admitted knowledge o\n criminal sentence and probation status for DUI and \ncarrying a concealed firearm. \no Despite initially trying to minimize and obfuscate the timeline, once confronted, \nAguirre admitte\nhad been sentenced i\n and she did not end \ntheir dating relationship unti\n  She remained living with him afterwards. \no \n \no \no \n \n \n- \nAguirre reviewed Penal Code 148(a)(1) and said she may have violated it by lying to the \nGrass Valley officers. \n \nIn summation, Aguirre was clearly in a volatile relationship that seemed co-dependent on alcohol \nconsumption.  The investigation indicated all the incidents involved copious amounts of alcohol.  \nAguirre struc\n on July 4, 2023, and later was dishonest and lied to officers about her \nactions.  She admitte\n  During that incident she identified herself \nas a member of the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office to the investigating officers.  Given the totality \nof circumstances, I believe Aguirre informed officers of her employment to gain favoritism and \ninfluence the outcome of the call. \n \n \nIA-2023-003 REVIEW AND FINDINGS \nCONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM \n6 | P a g e  \n \nLater the same month Aguirre sustained suspicious injuries that required treatment at the hospital.  \nAguirre was adamant with deputies and detectives that she did not know how she received her \ninjuries, yet while receiving treatment at the hospital she sent a Snapchat message to C.O. Wall \n(\ndid a number on me”) in which she insinuated\nhad caused them.  This casts doubt \nin my mind whether she was completely forthcoming in that incident about what she recalled. \n \n \nAfter reviewing the investigation and memorandum I reviewed the applicable policies and \npersonnel codes.  I considered each section applying the facts discovered during this investigation \nand came to my conclusions. \n \nFINDINGS: \n \n- \n \n- \n \n \n \n- \nPenal Code 148.5(a) – UNFOUNDED (Aguirre did not initiate nor report a violation of law.  \nIn fact, the opposite happened.  She knowingly lied to cover up a violation of law.) \no Every person who reports to any peace officer listed in Section 830.1 or 830.2, or \nsubdivision (a) of Section 830.33, the Attorney General, or a deputy attorney \ngeneral, or a deputy district attorney that a felony or misdemeanor has been \ncommitted, knowing the report to be false, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

Officers formulate a plan to go hands on the suspect and detain him (Officer Bonilla¿s BWV 2:51 time marker). Officers did not communicate \nwhat they believe the suspect was holding.   \nSuspect turned around and threw the item at Officers as Officers approached suspect (Officer Arellano¿s BWV 6:47 time marker). Officer Arellano \nbelieved the item would cause physical harm to Officers and shot a bean bag round toward the suspect¿s abdomen area to stop the threat. The bean \nbag round hit the suspect¿s right thigh. Due to lag time from acquiring his sights on the target with his background cleared, Officer Arellano shot the \nForm Number: UOFS R-19 NCAT All\nDate: 5/9/24\nUser Name: N3162\nPage 2 of 43\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nUOF REPORT -

I reviewed the arrest \nreport, the UOF investigation, the photos, BWV, DICVS, and the statements.  I am providing this insight.    \n  \n*Note*- The Use of Force Incident originated during an investigation of an Arson suspect.  The primary unit, Officers Chavez and \nTobias, were not involved in the Use of Force.  \n  \nUpon arrival at the scene, Officers Chavez and Tobias tactically deployed their vehicle.  Officers contacted the possible suspect of \nthe Arson radio call.  The suspect immediately walked away from officers, disregarding their directives.  \n  \nOfficers Chavez and Tobias requested additional resources and walked after the suspect.  Officers continuously broadcast their \nlocation as the suspect walked through traffic.  Prior to additional resources arriving, the suspect turned and ran from the officers.  \nOfficers initially slowly continued walking after the suspect until additional officers arrived.  Officers Chavez and Tobias directed \nresponding units towards the suspect, who had now run out of sight.  \n  \nUpon arriving at Adams and Longwood, a team of responding officers contacted the suspect.  The suspect, making erratic \nmovements and holding an unknown object in an elevated, baseball pitcher¿s throwing motion, refused to comply with the \nofficers¿ commands.    \n  \n*Note*- At this time, officers had formed a semi-circle near the suspect.  Several officers can be heard issuing directives to the \nsuspect, but the officers did not verbalize well amongst each other.     \n  \nOfficers Manning, Bonilla, Sarmiento, and Arellano were amongst the officers closing in on the suspect.  Officer Arellano was \nequipped with a Bean Bag shotgun, and while he is first heard on his body worn video declaring, ¿Bean Bag Up,¿ he made this \ndeclaration some ways away from most all other officers.    \n  \nWithout verbalizing to each other, Officers Manning and Bonilla seemed to both identify an opportunity to go hands on with the \nsuspect.  Both officers made forward movements towards the suspect to control him.  Prior to the officers grabbing him, the \nsuspect raised his left arm into a throwing position, Officer Arellano believed the suspect was going to throw the unknown object in \nhis left hand at one of the officers, potentially causing great injury, Officer Arellano discharged his bean bag shotgun one time into \nthe right leg of the suspect.    \n  \n*Note*- Officer Arellano did not verbalize with his partners that he had the bean bag shotgun and was prepared to use it.  The \nstandard preparatory alert, ¿Beanbag Ready!¿, was not issued.    \n  \nUpon being struck with the Beanbag sock round, the suspect immediately stopped his erratic movements and was taken to the \nground by officer Manning.  Officers Manning, Vargas, Sarmiento, and Bonilla gained control of the suspect through bodyweight, \nfirm grips, and handcuffing.  \n  \nSergeant Borunda responded to the scene and conducted a UOF investigation.  Sergeant Borunda did not locate any witnesses.    \n  \nI recommend the following:  \n  \nTakedown, Firm Grip, Bodyweight- Manning: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \nBodyweight, Firm Grips- Vargas: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \nFirm Grip- Sarmiento: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \nFirm Grip- Bonilla: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \n  \nBeanbag Shotgun- Arellano: In Policy/ Training for Tactics and UOF, Use of Force Tactics Directive, Directive No. 6.4, ¿Beanbag \nShotgun,¿ dated September 2020.  \n  \nThe discharge of the Beanbag shotgun, from approximately 7¿, was an appropriate force response to the suspect¿s actions of \npreparing to imminently throw an object at officers.  From Officer Arellano¿s perspective and statements, he believed that the \nsuspect both had the capacity and intention of throwing an unknown object at officers.  The discharge of a Beanbag shotgun at \nsuch proximity to the suspect and other officers has an increased risk of missing th\ne intended target.  In this incident though, Officer Arellano¿s strike was both true and effective.  \n  \nForm Number: UOFS R-19 NCAT All\nDate: 5/9/24\nUser Name: N3162\nPage 20 of 43\nFINDINGS (INTERNAL PROCESS REPORT)\nUOFS\nCase Number:  2038283\nDR No:      23-0311852\nCase Type:       NONCAT - II\nCase Status:  Closed\nDR Type:  Use of Force Report\nOfficer Arellano can clearly be heard declaring, ¿Beanbag Up!¿ when he first deploys it.  He was a good distance away from most \nevery other officer involved in the Use of Force when he made this declaration.  Officer Arellano most likely assumed that all other \nofficers observed the very distinguishable green colored shotgun as the team of officers was triangulating on the suspect, but \nduring tactical and/or high stress situations, Officers have been known to succumb to tunnel vision.  It would have helped all \nofficers at-scene if Arellano would have verbalized that he was equipped with the beanbag and prepared to use it while he and the \nother officers where triangulating on the suspect.  Officer Arellano also failed to admonish the suspect about the use of the \nbeanbag shotgun and its possible effects on the suspect.  While I agree with Officer Arellano¿s assessment that, in the moment he \ndecided to use this force option (as the suspect raised his arm in a throwing motion at officers who were within a very short \ndistance), he did not have time to declare the Use of Force admonishment, this mindset fails to consider earlier opportunities.   \n  \nAdditional:  \n  \nFoot Pursuit Tactics- Chavez: Informal Training  \nFoot Pursuit Tactics- Tobias: Informal Training  \n  \nWhile not directly involved in the Use of Force, the primary unit had a significant role in this incident.  After first contacting the \nsuspect, it is evident that the suspect had no intention of complying with the officer directives.  Maintaining calm, the officers \nmethodically moved towards the fleeing suspect while broadcasting their travel.  During the pursuit however, the suspect can be \nseen on the officers¿ body-worn video increasing his tempo and desire to avoid detention.  While continuing to maintain their \ndeliberate demeanor, the officers did not seem to have the same will as the suspect in increasing pace.  The officers continue to \nmethodically move towards the rapidly fleeing suspect, broadcasting his movements, until he is out of sight.  At about this time \nadditional units arrive at scene and the officers give their last, best, known direction of travel.  The responding officers speed away \ntowards the suspect while the primary continues to methodically move forward.  Eventually, an understanding of the moment \nseems to come upon the officers, and they can be seen upping their pace from a slow methodical walk into a jog.  Officers Chavez \nand Tobias maintaining such an enervated pursuit, allowed units to catch the suspect and negotiate through his erratic behavior \nwithout their incident knowledge or experience.    \n  \nI recommend officers Chavez and Tobias receive Informal Divisional Training on Use of Force Tactics Directive, Directive No. 3.2, \n¿Foot Pursuit Concepts,¿ dated October 2013.  \n  \n  \nFindings by No Org, WATCH COMMANDER - WILHELM, SCOTT - 36358\nDate Reviewed:\n6/15/2023\nDate Approved:\n6/15/2023\nReviewed History Date:\n6/15/2023\nTactic Finding Action:\nNone\nReviewed Work History:\nPolicy Change \nRecommendation:\nNo\nUse of Force Related \nComplaint Initiated:\nNo Force Used Information for this Employee\nAction(s) Taken:\nNo Data\nWork History Review Comments:\nFinding Review Comments:\nForm Number: UOFS R-19 NCAT All\nDate: 5/9/24\nUser Name: N3162\nPage 21 of 43\nFINDINGS (INTERNAL PROCESS REPORT)\nUOFS\nCase Number:  2038283\nDR No:      23-0311852\nCase Type:       NONCAT - II\nCase Status:  Closed\nDR Type:  Use of Force Report\nFindings by No Org, COMMANDING OFFICER - PLUGGE, MATTHEW - 35134\nDate Reviewed:\nDate Approved:\n11/15/2023\nReviewed History Date:\nTactic Finding Action:\nAdministrative \nApproval\nReviewed Work History:\nPolicy Change \nRecommendation:\nNo\nUse of Force Related \nComplaint Initiated:\nNo\nSuspect\nUOF Used\nLocation\nClassification\nAction\nDeguevara, Gabriel\nFirm Grip\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nDeguevara, Gabriel\nFirm Grip\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nAction(s) Taken:\nDivisional Training\nWork History Review Comments:\nFinding Review Comments:\nFindings by No Org, COMMANDING OFFICER - LOPEZ, JAMES - 32099\nDate Reviewed:\n7/1/2023\nDate Approved:\n7/1/2023\nReviewed History Date:\n7/1/2023\nTactic Finding Action:\nAdministrative \nApproval\nReviewed Work History:\nYes\nPolicy Change \nRecommendation:\nNo\nUse of Force Related \nComplaint Initiated:\nNo\nSuspect\nUOF Used\nLocation\nClassification\nAction\nDeguevara, Gabriel\nFirm Grip\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nAction(s) Taken:\nDivisional Training\nWork History Review Comments:\nFinding Review Comments:\nI, Captain James Lopez, Commanding Officer, Southwest Patrol, have reviewed the Arrest \nReport, use of force report, and BWV.

The suspect, making erratic \nmovements and holding an unknown object in an elevated, baseball pitcher¿s throwing motion, refused to comply with the \nofficers¿ commands.    \n  \n*Note*- At this time, officers had formed a semi-circle near the suspect.  Several officers can be heard issuing directives to the \nsuspect, but the officers did not verbalize well amongst each other.     \n  \nOfficers Manning, Bonilla, Sarmiento, and Arellano were amongst the officers closing in on the suspect.  Officer Arellano was \nequipped with a Bean Bag shotgun, and while he is first heard on his body worn video declaring, ¿Bean Bag Up,¿ he made this \ndeclaration some ways away from most all other officers.    \n  \nWithout verbalizing to each other, Officers Manning and Bonilla seemed to both identify an opportunity to go hands on with the \nsuspect.  Both officers made forward movements towards the suspect to control him.  Prior to the officers grabbing him, the \nsuspect raised his left arm into a throwing position, Officer Arellano believed the suspect was going to throw the unknown object in \nhis left hand at one of the officers, potentially causing great injury, Officer Arellano discharged his bean bag shotgun one time into \nthe right leg of the suspect.    \n  \n*Note*- Officer Arellano did not verbalize with his partners that he had the bean bag shotgun and was prepared to use it.  The \nstandard preparatory alert, ¿Beanbag Ready!¿, was not issued.    \n  \nUpon being struck with the Beanbag sock round, the suspect immediately stopped his erratic movements and was taken to the \nground by officer Manning.  Officers Manning, Vargas, Sarmiento, and Bonilla gained control of the suspect through bodyweight, \nfirm grips, and handcuffing.  \n  \nSergeant Borunda responded to the scene and conducted a UOF investigation.  Sergeant Borunda did not locate any witnesses.    \n  \nI recommend the following:  \n  \nTakedown, Firm Grip, Bodyweight- Manning: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \nBodyweight, Firm Grips- Vargas: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \nFirm Grip- Sarmiento: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \nFirm Grip- Bonilla: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \n  \nBeanbag Shotgun- Arellano: In Policy/ Training for Tactics and UOF, Use of Force Tactics Directive, Directive No. 6.4, ¿Beanbag \nShotgun,¿ dated September 2020.  \n  \nThe discharge of the Beanbag shotgun, from approximately 7¿, was an appropriate force response to the suspect¿s actions of \npreparing to imminently throw an object at officers.  From Officer Arellano¿s perspective and statements, he believed that the \nsuspect both had the capacity and intention of throwing an unknown object at officers.  The discharge of a Beanbag shotgun at \nsuch proximity to the suspect and other officers has an increased risk of missing th\ne intended target.

Officer Arellano most likely assumed that all other \nofficers observed the very distinguishable green colored shotgun as the team of officers was triangulating on the suspect, but \nduring tactical and/or high stress situations, Officers have been known to succumb to tunnel vision.  It would have helped all \nofficers at-scene if Arellano would have verbalized that he was equipped with the beanbag and prepared to use it while he and the \nother officers where triangulating on the suspect.  Officer Arellano also failed to admonish the suspect about the use of the \nbeanbag shotgun and its possible effects on the suspect.  While I agree with Officer Arellano¿s assessment that, in the moment he \ndecided to use this force option (as the suspect raised his arm in a throwing motion at officers who were within a very short \ndistance), he did not have time to declare the Use of Force admonishment, this mindset fails to consider earlier opportunities.   \n  \nAdditional:  \n  \nFoot Pursuit Tactics- Chavez: Informal Training  \nFoot Pursuit Tactics- Tobias: Informal Training  \n  \nWhile not directly involved in the Use of Force, the primary unit had a significant role in this incident.

Prior to the officers grabbing him, the \nsuspect raised his left arm into a throwing position, Officer Arellano believed the suspect was going to throw the unknown object in \nhis left hand at one of the officers, potentially causing great injury, Officer Arellano discharged his bean bag shotgun one time into \nthe right leg of the suspect.    \n  \n*Note*- Officer Arellano did not verbalize with his partners that he had the bean bag shotgun and was prepared to use it.  The \nstandard preparatory alert, ¿Beanbag Ready!¿, was not issued.    \n  \nUpon being struck with the Beanbag sock round, the suspect immediately stopped his erratic movements and was taken to the \nground by officer Manning.  Officers Manning, Vargas, Sarmiento, and Bonilla gained control of the suspect through bodyweight, \nfirm grips, and handcuffing.  \n  \nSergeant Borunda responded to the scene and conducted a UOF investigation.  Sergeant Borunda did not locate any witnesses.    \n  \nI recommend the following:  \n  \nTakedown, Firm Grip, Bodyweight- Manning: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \nBodyweight, Firm Grips- Vargas: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \nFirm Grip- Sarmiento: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \nFirm Grip- Bonilla: In Policy/ No Action for Tactics and UOF  \n  \nBeanbag Shotgun- Arellano: In Policy/ Training for Tactics and UOF, Use of Force Tactics Directive, Directive No. 6.4, ¿Beanbag \nShotgun,¿ dated September 2020.  \n  \nThe discharge of the Beanbag shotgun, from approximately 7¿, was an appropriate force response to the suspect¿s actions of \npreparing to imminently throw an object at officers.  From Officer Arellano¿s perspective and statements, he believed that the \nsuspect both had the capacity and intention of throwing an unknown object at officers.  The discharge of a Beanbag shotgun at \nsuch proximity to the suspect and other officers has an increased risk of missing th\ne intended target.  In this incident though, Officer Arellano¿s strike was both true and effective.  \n  \nForm Number: UOFS R-19 NCAT All\nDate: 5/9/24\nUser Name: N3162\nPage 36 of 43\nFINDINGS (INTERNAL PROCESS REPORT)\nUOFS\nCase Number:  2038283\nDR No:      23-0311852\nCase Type:       NONCAT - II\nCase Status:  Closed\nDR Type:  Use of Force Report\nOfficer Arellano can clearly be heard declaring, ¿Beanbag Up!¿ when he first deploys it.  He was a good distance away from most \nevery other officer involved in the Use of Force when he made this declaration.  Officer Arellano most likely assumed that all other \nofficers observed the very distinguishable green colored shotgun as the team of officers was triangulating on the suspect, but \nduring tactical and/or high stress situations, Officers have been known to succumb to tunnel vision.  It would have helped all \nofficers at-scene if Arellano would have verbalized that he was equipped with the beanbag and prepared to use it while he and the \nother officers where triangulating on the suspect.  Officer Arellano also failed to admonish the suspect about the use of the \nbeanbag shotgun and its possible effects on the suspect.  While I agree with Officer Arellano¿s assessment that, in the moment he \ndecided to use this force option (as the suspect raised his arm in a throwing motion at officers who were within a very short \ndistance), he did not have time to declare the Use of Force admonishment, this mindset fails to consider earlier opportunities.   \n  \nAdditional:  \n  \nFoot Pursuit Tactics- Chavez: Informal Training  \nFoot Pursuit Tactics- Tobias: Informal Training  \n  \nWhile not directly involved in the Use of Force, the primary unit had a significant role in this incident.  After first contacting the \nsuspect, it is evident that the suspect had no intention of complying with the officer directives.  Maintaining calm, the officers \nmethodically moved towards the fleeing suspect while broadcasting their travel.  During the pursuit however, the suspect can be \nseen on the officers¿ body-worn video increasing his tempo and desire to avoid detention.  While continuing to maintain their \ndeliberate demeanor, the officers did not seem to have the same will as the suspect in increasing pace.  The officers continue to \nmethodically move towards the rapidly fleeing suspect, broadcasting his movements, until he is out of sight.  At about this time \nadditional units arrive at scene and the officers give their last, best, known direction of travel.  The responding officers speed away \ntowards the suspect while the primary continues to methodically move forward.  Eventually, an understanding of the moment \nseems to come upon the officers, and they can be seen upping their pace from a slow methodical walk into a jog.  Officers Chavez \nand Tobias maintaining such an enervated pursuit, allowed units to catch the suspect and negotiate through his erratic behavior \nwithout their incident knowledge or experience.    \n  \nI recommend officers Chavez and Tobias receive Informal Divisional Training on Use of Force Tactics Directive, Directive No. 3.2, \n¿Foot Pursuit Concepts,¿ dated October 2013.  \n  \n  \nFindings by No Org, WATCH COMMANDER - WILHELM, SCOTT - 36358\nDate Reviewed:\n6/15/2023\nDate Approved:\n6/15/2023\nReviewed History Date:\n6/15/2023\nTactic Finding Action:\nNone\nReviewed Work History:\nPolicy Change \nRecommendation:\nNo\nUse of Force Related \nComplaint Initiated:\nNo Force Used Information for this Employee\nAction(s) Taken:\nNo Data\nWork History Review Comments:\nFinding Review Comments:\nForm Number: UOFS R-19 NCAT All\nDate: 5/9/24\nUser Name: N3162\nPage 37 of 43\nFINDINGS (INTERNAL PROCESS REPORT)\nUOFS\nCase Number:  2038283\nDR No:      23-0311852\nCase Type:       NONCAT - II\nCase Status:  Closed\nDR Type:  Use of Force Report\nFindings by No Org, COMMANDING OFFICER - PLUGGE, MATTHEW - 35134\nDate Reviewed:\nDate Approved:\n11/15/2023\nReviewed History Date:\nTactic Finding Action:\nAdministrative \nApproval\nReviewed Work History:\nPolicy Change \nRecommendation:\nNo\nUse of Force Related \nComplaint Initiated:\nNo\nSuspect\nUOF Used\nLocation\nClassification\nAction\nDeguevara, Gabriel\nFirm Grip\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nDeguevara, Gabriel\nBodyweight\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nDeguevara, Gabriel\nFirm Grip\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nDeguevara, Gabriel\nBodyweight\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nAction(s) Taken:\nDivisional Training\nWork History Review Comments:\nFinding Review Comments:\nFindings by No Org, COMMANDING OFFICER - LOPEZ, JAMES - 32099\nDate Reviewed:\n7/1/2023\nDate Approved:\n7/1/2023\nReviewed History Date:\n7/1/2023\nTactic Finding Action:\nAdministrative \nApproval\nReviewed Work History:\nYes\nPolicy Change \nRecommendation:\nNo\nUse of Force Related \nComplaint Initiated:\nNo\nSuspect\nUOF Used\nLocation\nClassification\nAction\nDeguevara, Gabriel\nFirm Grip\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nDeguevara, Gabriel\nBodyweight\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nAction(s) Taken:\nDivisional Training\nWork History Review Comments:\nFinding Review Comments:\nI, Captain James Lopez, Commanding Officer, Southwest Patrol, have reviewed the Arrest \nReport, use of force report, and BWV.

This \nfactual summary is based on a thorough review of all the investigative reports, \nphotographs, video, and audio recordings submitted by the San Bernardino County \nSheriff’s Department. \n \nFACTUAL SUMMARY \n \nOn the afternoon of August 15, 2023, around 3:50 p.m., Alejandro Diaz stormed onto the \nSierra Lakes Golf Course, shouting, and brandishing a black handgun. Sweating \nprofusely and visibly agitated, Diaz waved the gun around, causing golfers to run and \nhide. Employees rushed inside the clubhouse and locked the doors. \n \nAt 3:54 p.m., multiple witnesses at the golf course began calling 911 for assistance. As \nthe 911 calls came in, police were already on their way. Just six minutes earlier, Witness \n#1 had called 911 to report her husband, Alejandro Diaz, an off-duty Los Angeles County \nSheriff’s Deputy, was experiencing some sort of breakdown, had shot a gun inside their \nhome, and had left the residence on foot, armed with two handguns. The Diaz residence \nwas located within the Sierra Lakes Golf Course community in Fontana, only two-tenths \na mile from the clubhouse. Witness #1, clearly in great distress, told the 911 operator that \nshe did not know where Diaz had gone.  \n \nFontana Police Sergeant Brian McLane, in his patrol unit near the scene, listened to \nWitness #1’s 911 call on his unit’s Live911 system and immediately headed for the golf \ncourse. As did Corporal David Campa and Officer Casey Mutter. Officer Leonard Sein \nand his trainee Officer Tyrell Jones were taking a theft report at a nearby store when they \nheard the triple tone, alerting all officers to an emergency in progress, over their unit radio. \nBreaking from the theft call, Officers Sein and Jones quickly headed for the golf course. \n \nAs the officers made their way to the course, they learned that multiple 911 callers were \nreporting a man with a gun was at the Sierra Lakes Golf Course. Fearing they were about \nto have an active shooter at the golf course, the officers raced to the scene. Several \nwitnesses reported the man with a gun was near “the starter,” or hole one, which the \nofficers believed was near the clubhouse. The officers arrived at the course within \nminutes, stopping their units near the clubhouse. Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, \nand Officer Mutter grabbed their patrol rifles and headed on foot for the putting green in \nfront of the clubhouse in search of Diaz. Officers Sein and Jones quickly caught up, \nrunning to join their partners. The officers promptly spotted Diaz about 40 yards away \nbeside a golf cart parked on the cart path that ran along the putting green in front of the \nclubhouse.   \n \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 3 \n \n \nDiaz wore a gray shirt and black shorts and matched the description given by Witness #1 \nand the witnesses at the golf course. Sergeant McLane noted that Diaz was so drenched \nin sweat that it looked like someone had poured water on him. Confident this was the man \nthey were looking for, the officers immediately ordered Diaz to show his hands and not to \nreach for anything as they moved in his direction. On his knees beside the golf cart, Diaz \nlooked at the officers and raised his left hand but kept his right hand down near his side, \nhidden from view.  \n \nThe five officers quickly and cautiously moved across the putting green toward Diaz, \nfanning out from one another and forming a half-circle between Diaz and the clubhouse. \nThe officers repeatedly commanded Diaz to keep his hands up and not to reach for \nanything, but Diaz kept his right hand down by his side, hidden from the officers’ view. \nThe clubhouse was situated directly behind the officers as they moved across the putting \ngreen toward Diaz. Inside the clubhouse, frightened patrons and employees watched the \nsituation unfold. Diaz remained on his knees, facing the officers. As the officers moved in \ncloser, they saw Diaz reaching around on the ground behind his body, as if trying to find \nsomething. Believing Diaz was reaching for a gun, the officers told him repeatedly, “Don’t \ndo it!” \n \nDiaz suddenly moved from a kneeling position down onto his side and reclined backward, \nstill reaching with his right hand for something on the ground behind him. Officer Jones \nwas close enough to see the black handgun on the ground near Diaz, but the other \nofficers did not see the gun until Diaz sat up, holding it in his right hand. Diaz pointed the \ngun at the officers, prompting them to fire their weapons in response. Diaz was struck by \ngunfire and began falling backward, discharging his handgun into the air before falling \nonto his back and dropping the gun. No officers or civilians were hit by gunfire. \nImmediately after the shooting, Officer Sein radioed “shots fired” and requested medical \naid at 3:58 p.m. The officers quickly approached Diaz, disarmed him, and began \nrendering aid. Diaz was transported to the hospital, where he later succumbed to his \ninjuries and was pronounced deceased at 4:52 p.m. \n \nSTATEMENTS BY POLICE OFFICERS1 \n \nThe involved officers were employed by the Fontana Police Department. Each officer \ndrove distinctively marked patrol units and wore marked uniforms identifying them as \npolice officers. The officers’ body-worn cameras were activated during the incident under \nreview and each officer was given the opportunity to review body-worn camera video of \nthe incident prior to their interviews. The department issued firearms used by each officer \nduring the officer-involved shooting and the number of shots fired by each is as follows: \n \nSergeant Brian McLane \n \nHeckler and Koch MP5 rifle \n2 shots \nCorporal David Campa \n \nColt M4 Carbine rifle \n \n5 shots \nOfficer Casey Mutter \n \nColt M4 Carbine rifle \n \n9 shots \n \n1 Herein is a summary only. All reports submitted were reviewed, but not all are referenced here. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 4 \n \n \nOfficer Tyrell Jones  \n \nGlock 17 9mm handgun \n \n5 shots \nOfficer Leonard Sein \n \nGlock 22 40 caliber handgun \n9 shots \n \n \n \n          Google map image of scene with markings by Officer Sein.2  \n \nOn August 29, 2023, at approximately 1:22 p.m., Sergeant Brian McLane was \ninterviewed by Detectives Nicholas Paslak and Justin Carty of the San Bernardino County \nSheriff’s Department. \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Sergeant McLane was on duty as a patrol sergeant for the day shift \npatrol team. Sergeant McLane’s marked patrol unit was equipped with a program called \nLive911 which allowed him to listen to 911 calls as they were received by dispatch. The \n \n2 Each involved officer individually marked his position relative to Diaz at the time of the shooting on a separate map \npage. During the shooting, the officers stood several feet apart from each other on the putting green. As such, the \nofficers’ markings were substantially similar. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 5 \n \n \nability to listen to the 911 calls afforded supervising officers with the ability to manage and \ndistribute resources before the call was entered into the system for the patrol units. While \non patrol, Sergeant McLane always had the Live911 program running so he could listen \nto the 911 calls as they were received. Based on his experience, the Live911 program \nhas about a three to seven second delay. Having listened to multiple calls since the \nprogram’s inception, Sergeant McLane has learned to discern which calls may require \nthe attention of a supervisor as opposed to the calls that require just a standard response \nfrom patrol officers. \n \nOn August 15, 2024, at about 3:30 p.m., Sergeant McLane was in his patrol unit on \nPalmetto Avenue, just south of Baseline Road. Sergeant McLane heard a 911 call come \nin over the Live911 system. The caller was a female (later determined to be Witness #1) \nand as she spoke to the dispatcher, Sergeant McLane noted Witness #1 had difficulty \ncommunicating and seemed very emotional. As the dispatcher tried to elicit more \ninformation, Witness #1 was unable to answer simple questions quickly with good \ninformation. Because Witness #1 seemed to have a hard time communicating what had \nhappened, Sergeant McLane believed Witness #1 was emotionally overwhelmed. \nSergeant McLane heard Witness #1 say something about, “There was a gunshot that had \nhappened in the house.” Upon hearing that a gun had been fired in the residence, \nSergeant McLane began heading toward the house. Sergeant McLane heard the “triple \ntone” go out over their primary channel. The triple tone is used to put all officers on notice \nwhen a call requiring law enforcement response is dangerous, for instance, gunshots \nbeing fired or a felony crime in progress. \n \nSergeant McLane turned his unit radio down to focus on the Live911 system so he could \nhear the 911 call between Witness #1 and the dispatcher as it developed in “real-time.” \nAs he drove to the house, Sergeant McLane heard the dispatcher ask Witness #1 if it was \nher husband who had fired the shot and whether the shot was fired intentionally at her or \nat the wall. Witness #1 was unable to answer the dispatcher’s question and replied \nsomething to the effect of, “Well, I hope it was intentionally at the wall.” Witness #1 \nreported that her husband (later identified as Alejandro Diaz) was “off-duty and that his \ngun was his duty weapon.” \n \nSergeant McLane quickened his response to the location, activating his lights and sirens \nto get around traffic when he came upon it. As Sergeant McLane reached an intersection \nat Sierra Lakes Parkway, he heard Witness #1 say that Diaz had left the house on foot, \narmed with two handguns. Sergeant McLane could see that the 911 call had originated \nfrom a house just north of Sierra Lakes Golf Club and confirmed this information with \ndispatch. Sergeant McLane believed that the “path of least travel” for Diaz was to go \nstraight south to the golf course. Sergeant McLane knew he would drive past the golf \ncourse on his way to the Diaz residence, so when he got to Clubhouse Drive, he turned \nwest and headed toward the golf course. Sergeant McLane got to the intersection of \nAugusta Drive and Clubhouse Drive, which was right before the start of the golf course. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 6 \n \n \nSergeant McLane advised over his police radio that he was “97 in the area”3 and would \nbe standing by at Augusta and Clubhouse for more information. Sergeant McLane knew \nadditional officers were responding to the location, so he staged at that intersection.  \n \nSergeant McLane’s thinking was, “We’ve got a man who was involved in some type of \ndomestic incident that rose to the level of at least one gunshot being fired inside the \nproperty, the female who is clearly confused and in an emotionally heightened state and \nnot really able to articulate answers to simple questions that the dispatcher is asking,” \nand Sergeant McLane was concerned that even though Witness #1 said Diaz had fired \ninto a wall, there was a possibility that someone in the house might have been injured. \nHowever, given the fact that Diaz had left the residence on foot and was armed with two \nhandguns, Sergeant McLane was also concerned about the fact that Diaz was now in an \nopen area which was heavily populated by people on the golf course and the golf club \nparking lot. Familiar with the area around the golf course, Sergeant McLane knew it was \nalways packed at that time of day. Because of this, Sergeant McLane wanted to wait there \nfor additional resources. Additionally, Sergeant McLane did not want to pass by Diaz while \ndriving his marked police unit and push Diaz into a hiding spot. Sergeant McLane turned \nhis unit radio back up and heard the dispatcher say they were now receiving multiple 911 \ncalls about a man with a gun at the golf course and the golf clubhouse. Sergeant McLane \nlooked at his screen and saw all the 911 calls populating regarding a man with a gun at \nthe golf course. \n \nAt this point, Sergeant McLane’s prevailing thought was that they had an active shooter \nsituation unfolding. Sergeant McLane thought, “We’ve got a guy who’s already willing to \nshoot, possibly injure somebody at his house,” and “now, he’s put himself into a populated \narea that is wide open, armed with two handguns.” Based on Sergeant McLane’s training \nand experience, he knew that public places with soft security were common targets for \nactive shooter engagements. Sergeant McLane knew that civilians enjoying recreation at \nthe golf course would not be “in a condition mentally to defend themselves, physically \ndefend themselves, if they’re just there for downtime, and this guy comes around with a \nhandgun.”  \n \nSergeant McLane started driving slowly, heading westbound on Clubhouse Drive toward \nthe clubhouse. The golf course was on the north side of the street, so Sergeant McLane \ndrove slowly to ensure he didn’t pass by Diaz without seeing him. Sergeant McLane \nunlocked his MP5 rifle from the unit lock and placed it on his lap so he could respond \nmore quickly if he started being shot at while he drove. \n \nSergeant McLane saw a man wearing a maroon shirt and black shorts in the distance at \nthe “start of the golf course,” which was down the street from the location from which the \noriginal 911 call had originated. Sergeant McLane believed Diaz had been described as \nwearing a gray shirt and black shorts but asked the dispatcher to verify Diaz’s description. \nWhile waiting for dispatch to reply, Sergeant McLane watched the man in the maroon \n \n3 On scene. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 7 \n \n \nshirt. Dispatch advised that Diaz wore a gray shirt and black shorts. Based on this \ndescription and the behavior of the man in the maroon shirt, Sergeant McLane ruled the \nman out as the suspect.  \n \nSergeant McLane drove into the golf course parking lot but did not park directly in front of \nthe clubhouse because he didn’t know where Diaz was. Dispatch had advised that the \n911 callers were saying the man with a gun was near “the starter.” Sergeant McLane did \nnot know what “the starter” was but believed it was probably “hole one or near hole one,” \nwhich Sergeant McLane surmised was near the clubhouse. Sergeant McLane got out of \nhis unit and slung his MP5 onto his body to secure it. Concerned about an active shooter \nsituation, Sergeant McLane’s goal was to find Diaz and draw Diaz’s attention toward \nhimself. Sergeant McLane believed that drawing Diaz’s attention to himself would ensure \nthat Diaz would not be focused on golfers, staff, and any other nearby civilians. \nResidences surrounded the golf course, so Sergeant McLane was also concerned about \nDiaz making it to one of the houses. Sergeant McLane wanted to draw Diaz’s attention to \nestablish communication with him.  \n \nCorporal Campa and Officer Mutter arrived at the golf course parking lot and met up with \nSergeant McLane as he exited his vehicle. Over the radio, Sergeant McLane asked for \nair support and advised that he, Corporal Campa, and Officer Mutter were \"deploying on \nfoot.\" Sergeant McLane believed air support was critical because they did not know where \nDiaz was. The officers started walking down a walkway west of the clubhouse, which led \nto a putting green. A split second after they began walking, Officers Sein and Jones \narrived and joined Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officer Mutter. Sergeant \nMcLane had worked with the officers, both as a peer and as a supervisor. Sergeant \nMcLane had attended multiple \"movement trainings, active shooter trainings, range \ntrainings, and de-escalation trainings\" with the officers. He was confident the team did not \nneed to verbalize their plan, which was to go out to approach Diaz on foot and try to \nestablish communication. \n \nThe team of officers walked along the walkway toward the putting green. There was a \n“huge open area” to the officers’ left, front, and right. Sergeant McLane saw golfers or \nstaff to their north and west, down on the other side of a tree line. A golf cart was parked \nbeside the putting green just before the tree line. Sergeant McLane saw Diaz wearing \nblack shorts and a light gray shirt beside the golf cart. Diaz’s light gray shirt had a dark \nU-shaped sweat line over the chest, up toward his shoulders, and around his neck. The \nsweat line was so dark that it looked like someone had poured water onto it or like \nsomeone’s shirt would look after a very intense workout. Based on Diaz’s appearance, \ncombined with the statements given during the 911 call, Sergeant McLane believed Diaz \nwas experiencing “some type of manic physical response to reality,” whether it was fueled \nby alcohol, drugs, or lack of sleep, Sergeant McLane did not know. Sergeant McLane was \nconfident this was the man who had reportedly left his house armed with two guns. \nSergeant McLane did not initially see anything in Diaz’s hands. \n \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 8 \n \n \nSergeant McLane estimated Diaz was 40 yards away. There was nothing between Diaz \nand the officers as they approached him, so there was no cover or concealment where \nthe officers could stop and try to communicate to Diaz from a position of safety. Sergeant \nMcLane knew they had to get closer to Diaz to draw his attention to them and establish \ncommunication. The goal was to talk to Diaz, to try to de-escalate the situation to a point \nwhere they could detain Diaz and conduct a criminal investigation or a mental health \nevaluation.  \n \nSergeant McLane told his partners that he saw Diaz right ahead of them, and they \ncontinued walking down toward Diaz, closing the distance. The officers did not run toward \nDiaz but made a tactical approach, walking toward Diaz at a “nice, smooth, comfortable” \npace. As they neared Diaz, Sergeant McLane said, “Hey man, hey bro, show me your \nhands. Let me see your hands.” Sergeant McLane repeated this multiple times. The other \nofficers gave similar commands, and there was no panic, yelling, or vulgarity involved.  \n \nDiaz was standing near the rear passenger side of the golf cart. Diaz was facing the golf \ncart and was “just moving around.” Diaz’s “actions did not make a whole lot of sense or \nhave any productive reasoning to them” as far as Sergeant McLane could decipher. When \nSergeant McLane first started trying to communicate with Diaz, Diaz looked his way and \nmade eye contact with him. Sergeant McLane was hopeful that they would be able to \nestablish a positive line of communication. However, Diaz quickly “looked away and went \nback to these, these movements around his golf cart.” Because Diaz was moving his \nhands around, they were not always in view, which meant Sergeant McLane couldn’t \nalways see them.  \n \nAs the officers approached, Diaz turned away and went down to his knees. Diaz’s left \nside faced toward Sergeant McLane. Diaz’s elbows were bent and pointed to the ground \nand his hands were up by his head. Sergeant McLane thought Diaz was hearing what the \nofficers were saying to him because he was in a submissive position that would allow the \nofficers to safely detain Diaz. However, that was “very short lived,” because Diaz put his \nhands down onto the grass. Sergeant McLane still did not see a gun, but then the next \nmoment, Diaz had a gun in his right hand. Sergeant McLane thought, “Fuck, he’s got a \ngun!” Sergeant McLane did not know where the gun came from, whether it came from the \ngolf cart or somewhere on the ground. Sergeant McLane held his MP5 rifle at the low \nready position, level with his chin, and wasn’t looking through the rifle’s sight up until that \npoint. \n \nWhen Diaz grabbed the gun, Sergeant McLane heard his partners giving verbal \ncommands to the effect of, “Show us your hands! Don’t do it!” Sergeant McLane briefly \nstopped when he saw Diaz with the gun, assessed the situation, and then continued \nmoving forward. Diaz was on his knees with the gun in his right hand as he turned to face \nSergeant McLane. When Sergeant McLane saw Diaz with the gun, he focused on Diaz’s \ngun because he realized that the threat to his life and the lives of his partners was \nelevated. Sergeant McLane brought up his rifle and pointed it at Diaz’s center of mass. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 9 \n \n \nDiaz faced Sergeant McLane and rolled to his left side with the gun in his right hand. \nDiaz’s gun was initially down, with Diaz’s “palm facing down as he held it toward the \nputting green,” but then Diaz brought the gun up and pointed it right at Sergeant McLane. \nAs soon as Diaz raised the gun, Sergeant McLane saw the muzzle of the gun pointed \nright at him. Even though the gun was pointed at Sergeant McLane, Sergeant McLane’s \npartners were right next to him. When Sergeant McLane saw the muzzle of Diaz’s gun \npointed right at him, he realized the threat to his and his partners’ lives was imminent. \nSergeant McLane’s fear was “through the roof.” Sergeant McLane fired two rounds in \nquick succession at Diaz to stop the threat he posed to his life and the lives of his partners. \nSergeant McLane estimated he was 10 to 15 yards away from Diaz when he fired and \nbelieved he was the first officer in the group to fire at Diaz. Sergeant McLane side-stepped \nto his left as he fired and heard other officers’ gunfire. Sergeant McLane saw several \nrounds hitting the grass around where Diaz sat. Sergeant McLane saw Diaz’s gun “go up \nto the air and then the next thing” that Sergeant McLane remembered as he sidestepped \nto the left, Diaz’s gun had fallen and was “now right underneath his arm.” Sergeant \nMcLane did not see Diaz fire his handgun. \n \nWhen Sergeant McLane saw Diaz’s gun fall to the ground, he told his partners to “cease \nfire” or to stop firing. Sergeant McLane believed Diaz was still a threat because he could \nsee the gun beneath Diaz’s arm, but with the gun no longer pointed at the officers, the \nthreat was no longer imminent. Sergeant McLane believed Diaz had been struck by \ngunfire because Diaz was lying on his back with his arms bent and his hands by his head. \nSergeant McLane kept his eyes locked on the gun as he and the other officers quickly \napproached Diaz. Sergeant McLane grabbed the handgun Diaz had pointed at him and \nmoved it a few feet away so that it was out of Diaz’s reach. \n \nSergeant McLane knew he and the officers needed to provide medical aid to Diaz. Diaz \nwas positioned partly on the putting green and partly on the cart path. Sergeant McLane \ngrabbed Diaz’s arms and another officer grabbed Diaz’s legs and they moved Diaz onto \nthe putting green so they would have a solid foundation to render medical care. As they \nbegan assessing Diaz for injuries, Sergeant McLane requested medical aid come to the \nscene. While waiting for paramedics, the officers rendered medical aid.  \n \nDiaz had an empty holster on the waistband of his shorts, but Sergeant McLane never \nsaw a second gun and did not know where the second gun was located. Sergeant McLane \nand the other shooting officers were transitioned away from the scene, relieved by other \nuninvolved officers. Sergeant McLane estimated only a minute and a half had passed \nbetween the time he stepped out of his patrol until the officers began rendering aid after \nofficer-involved shooting. \n \nOn August 29, 2023, Corporal David Campa was interviewed by Detectives Nicholas \nPaslak and Justin Carty of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. \n \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 10 \n \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Corporal Campa was on duty, assigned to the day shift patrol. \nCorporal Campa’s patrol unit was equipped with the Live911 system which allowed him \nto listen to 911 calls when they came into their dispatch center. Shortly before 4:00 p.m., \nCorporal Campa listened to a 911 call placed by a female who was screaming and out of \nbreath. Corporal Campa thought the call was “out of the ordinary” because the female \nsounded like she was scared and in distress. The Live911 system provided a “geo map” \nshowing the area from which the call had been placed. Upon seeing the call had \noriginated from the Sierra Lakes area, Corporal Campa began driving to the location. \nWhile driving to the location, Corporal Campa heard the female say that her husband had \nshot into the wall. The caller was not answering all of the dispatcher’s questions, which \nCorporal Campa attributed to her being in shock or distress. The dispatcher asked the \ncaller if her husband had shot at the wall “on purpose,” and she answered, “I don’t know. \nI hope so.” Corporal Campa thought “somebody’s life was in danger” because a rational \nperson would not shoot a gun in their house. The female caller described her husband as \nwearing a gray shirt and black shorts and advised he had left the residence. Either the \nfemale caller or her son told dispatch that Diaz was armed with two guns when he left the \nresidence.4 The caller advised that her husband was a deputy with the Los Angeles \nCounty Sheriff’s Department. Upon learning that Diaz was a law enforcement officer, \nCorporal Campa knew that Diaz was well trained, would know police tactics, and would \ntherefore know the officers’ tactics as they encountered him. \n \nCorporal Campa and Officer Mutter were dispatched to the location; Sergeant McLane \nadvised he was en route as well. As Corporal Campa drove down Clubhouse Drive, he \nsaw Sergeant McLane staged near the scene at Sierra Lakes Golf Course, waiting for \nadditional officers to arrive. Corporal Campa heard dispatch advise that several parties \nwere reporting there was a man with a gun at Sierra Lakes Golf Course near hole number \none. Corporal Campa thought, “Okay, this guy, he has some type of domestic argument \nwith his wife. He shot a round in the house, at least one round that I know of. He’s armed \nwith two guns. Now he ran, drove, I don’t know how he got there, but he’s at the Sierra \nLakes Golf Course, and you’ve got multiple people calling saying he’s armed with a gun.”  \n \nCorporal Campa feared they had an active shooter situation because Diaz had fired a  \ngun in his house, had left the residence while armed with two handguns, and now there \nwere multiple parties at the golf course reporting a man with a gun. Recognizing that \npeople’s lives were in danger, Corporal Campa knew they had to find Diaz. Corporal \nCampa’s goal was to contact Diaz to detain or arrest him and conduct an investigation to \ndetermine what if any, crime he committed. \n \nCorporal Campa and Sergeant McLane drove to the main entrance at the front of the \nclubhouse. Several cars were parked in the golf course parking lot, so Corporal Campa \nknew several people were present at the golf course. Corporal Campa parked his unit \nand retrieved his department-issued Colt M4 patrol rifle from the trunk, racking a round \ninto the chamber. Corporal Campa retrieved his rifle because he knew they might \n \n4 Corporal Campa could not recall which party told the dispatcher this. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 11 \n \n \nencounter Diaz from 100 yards away on the golf course, which was essentially an open \nfield. The rifle would better equip Corporal Campa if he needed to defend his life, his \npartners’ lives, or the lives of citizens from that distance. \n \nSergeant McLane called for 40-King, the Sheriff’s helicopter, to assist in locating Diaz. \nCorporal Campa knew they did not have “the comfort to wait and see” whether Diaz \nstarted shooting people. With lives in danger, Corporal Campa knew they needed to find \nDiaz immediately. Officer Mutter joined Corporal Campa and Sergeant McLane as they \nbegan walking from the parking lot toward the golf course. Officer Sein and his trainee, \nOfficer Jones, caught up shortly after. As the officers approached the course, Corporal \nCampa saw a small cart path west of the clubhouse’s front entrance, which Corporal \nCampa believed led to hole one. Corporal Campa saw two golf carts on the cart path, \nabout 30 to 40 yards away. Corporal Campa noticed a man wearing a gray shirt and black \nshorts, matching the description given by the 911 caller, sitting down near the two golf \ncarts. \n \nAs they walked past the main clubhouse, Officer Campa saw people standing at the \nclubhouse. Corporal Campa yelled at them, \"Where's he at?\" The people pointed toward \nthe man (later identified as Diaz) sitting near the golf carts. As the officers approached \nDiaz, Corporal Campa saw three to four golfers in the distance to the north. Seeing the \ngolfers so far away from their golf carts was strange, and Corporal Campa thought, \n\"Something's going on here.\" Corporal Campa was not sure whether Diaz had tried to kill \nhis wife, but until the officers had a chance to speak with her, they did not know whether \nDiaz had shot at the wall or tried to kill her. As the officers made their approach, Diaz \nstarted \"yelling something toward\" the officers and pointed to his west \"saying something \nlike, 'Hey, he's over there, he's over there.'\" Corporal Campa knew something was not \nadding up because everyone at the clubhouse was saying that Diaz was the man with the \ngun. Corporal Campa believed Diaz was trying to lure the officers into an ambush to kill \nthem. Corporal Campa held his rifle at the low-ready, looking at Diaz over the top of his \noptic sights as they approached from a distance. Corporal Campa began looking at Diaz \nthrough his rifle's sights as he got closer to Diaz. \n \nWhen the officers were about 20 yards away from Diaz, they began giving Diaz \ncommands to show his hands. Diaz was sitting down, facing the officers with his legs \nextended forward. Diaz had his right hand behind his back, out of view. Sergeant McLane \nwas positioned to the right of Corporal Campa. Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein were to \nthe right of Sergeant McLane, but Corporal Campa did not recall in which order they \nstood. The officers gave Diaz multiple commands to show his hands and told Diaz, “Don’t \ndo it.” Diaz acknowledged the officers by lifting his left hand upward. Corporal Campa \nsaw Diaz’s left palm but could not see his right hand. As the officers neared Diaz, Corporal \nCampa heard what he believed, based on his training and experience, was a gun falling \nto the ground. Corporal Campa did not see a firearm near Diaz but could see that Diaz \nwas moving his right arm, which he kept concealed from the officers. Corporal Campa \nbelieved that everyone stopped their approach toward Diaz at this point. Diaz was not \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 12 \n \n \nlistening to their commands and was concealing his right hand from their view. Corporal \nCampa and his partners were in front of Diaz without cover or concealment. \n \nCorporal Campa believed Diaz had a gun and feared Diaz was going to shoot the officers. \nDiaz then leaned to his right side, reclining backward at a downward angle, and turned \nback to face the officers. When Diaz turned toward the officers, Corporal Campa saw a \nblack semi-automatic handgun in Diaz’s right hand. Diaz started “wheeling” the gun \ntoward the officers. When Diaz pointed the gun directly at the officers, Corporal Campa \nhad no doubt Diaz intended to kill him and his partners. Fearing that he and his partners \nwere going to die, Corporal Campa fired several rounds from his rifle at Diaz to stop his \nattack. Corporal Campa aimed for Diaz’s center mass area and estimated he fired “four \nto six rounds, maybe give or take one or two,” in quick succession from a distance of 15 \nyards. As Corporal Campa fired, in his periphery, he saw Sergeant McLane also shooting. \nCorporal Campa knew his partners had also fired but did not know how many rounds they \nfired. \n \nThe officers immediately approached Diaz, who had fallen onto the pathway/curb area. \nThe officers moved Diaz onto the grass, where they administered aid to him until medics \narrived and took over Diaz’s care. \n \nOn August 30, 2023, Officer Casey Mutter was interviewed by Detectives Nicholas \nPaslak and Francisco Demara of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Officer Mutter was on duty, assigned to the day shift patrol. Officer \nMutter’s patrol unit was equipped with the Live911 system, which allowed him to listen to \n911 calls when they came into their dispatch center. Shortly before 4:00 p.m., Officer \nMutter was sitting in his patrol unit behind Home Depot on Sierra Lakes Parkway and \nCitrus Avenue, preparing to make a phone call when he received a message on his \ncomputer from dispatch. Dispatch asked Officer Mutter to listen to a live 911 call.  \n \nOfficer Mutter tuned into the 911 call and heard a female caller who sounded out of breath \nand scared. The caller stated that her husband had shot the wall inside their house. The \ndispatcher began asking the caller if she and her husband were arguing or if the shooting \nwas accidental. The caller was “not forthcoming with a lot of information.” When the \ndispatcher asked if the shooting was accidental, the caller said she thought it was but \nwasn’t sure. Officer Mutter believed there was “something more going on,” likely a \ndomestic dispute, and that the shooting was more than “just an accidental discharge in \nthe house.” \n \nStill listening to the 911 call, Officer Mutter began driving quickly toward the 911 caller’s \nresidence north of Sierra Lakes Golf Club. When Officer Mutter heard the caller say that \nher husband (later identified as Diaz) had left the residence, he slowed down because he \nbelieved there was no longer an immediate threat. Officer Mutter was close to the \nresidence and wanted to ascertain where his backing officers were because he did not \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 13 \n \n \nwant to drive up to the house alone and find an armed suspect in a potential domestic \ndispute who had already fired a round inside the house waiting for him outside the home. \n \nWhile Officer Mutter was driving north on Medinah Street, approaching Clubhouse Drive, \ndispatch advised they were receiving calls that there was a man (later identified as Diaz) \narmed with a gun on the golf course. Familiar with the golf course, Officer Mutter knew it \nwas common for people to be there at that time of day. Recognizing the danger to the \npublic and the potential for 30, 40, or 50 victims at the golf course, Officer Mutter \nimmediately turned onto Clubhouse Drive and went directly to the golf course. As he drove \ninto the golf course parking lot, Officer Mutter saw approximately 30 to 40 cars parked \nthere. Based on this, Officer Mutter knew people were present at the golf course, and his \nmain goal was to get in between them and Diaz. Officer Mutter estimated it took him about \ntwo to two and a half minutes to get to the golf course from the Home Depot parking lot. \nDiaz’s home was north of the clubhouse, so Officer Mutter parked on the eastern side of \nthe clubhouse, hoping to cut Diaz off if he was walking toward the clubhouse.5 Officer \nMutter grabbed his patrol rifle, got out his unit, and chambered a round. Officer Mutter \nchose his rifle because he believed it was the best weapon to have should he need to \n“take action at a distance” against someone armed with a handgun. \n \nDispatch advised that witnesses were reporting the armed man was near the starting \npoint of the course. Having previously golfed at the Sierra Lakes Golf course, Officer \nMutter knew the starting point would be closer to hole one on the south side of the \nclubhouse. Officer Mutter walked to the south side of the clubhouse, where he met \nSergeant McLane, who had just arrived, along with Corporal Campa. When Officer Mutter \nmet up with Sergeant McLane, he learned through dispatch that Diaz was reportedly \narmed with two guns.6  \n \nOfficer Mutter heard over the radio that a BearCat (Fontana Police Department’s large, \narmored vehicle) and the Sheriff’s helicopter had been called to respond to the golf \ncourse. Multiple callers were reporting a man was waving a gun around at the golf course. \nBased on his training and experience, Officer Mutter knew that public places with soft \nsecurity were common targets for active shooter situations. Officer Mutter did not know \nwhat Diaz’s intentions were, but he knew they needed to quickly contain Diaz to prevent \nhim from becoming an active shooter. Because of this, the officers did not have time to \nformulate a plan. However, Officer Mutter had worked with Sergeant McLane and Officer \nCampa for several years and knew, based on their collective training and experience, that \nthey all recognized the need to immediately locate Diaz and contain him to prevent him \nfrom harming anyone.  \n \n \n5 As shown on Google Maps, there was no parking lot on the north side of the clubhouse; the parking lots were located \nsouth and east of the clubhouse. \n6 Officer Mutter did not learn that Diaz was an off-duty Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputy until after the officer-\ninvolved shooting. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 14 \n \n \nAs the officers walked toward the golf course, Officer Mutter saw golfers running north on \nthe driving range, which brought Officer Mutter's attention just to the left, where he saw \ntwo golf carts and Diaz on the pathway at the starting point area for hole one. Diaz was \nabout 35 to 40 yards away from the officers. Diaz wore a gray shirt and black shorts, \nmatching the description given by witnesses. Diaz's shirt was drenched in sweat. Diaz \nstood at the back of one of the golf carts and looked like he was trying to blend in as a \ngolfer, rummaging as if he was getting something out of a bag on the back of the golf cart. \nDiaz pointed his arm southward toward a thick tree line, and Officer Mutter heard Diaz \nsay there was someone with a gun in the bushes. It wasn't easy to see anything beyond \nthe trees. Officer Mutter believed Diaz was trying to \"bait\" the officers in to get them closer \nand to divert their attention away from himself so \"he could try to kill one of us.\"   \n \nSergeant McLane began giving commands to Diaz to get down and to put his hands up. \nDiaz turned toward the officers, fell to his knees, and put his hands in the air. Officer \nMutter felt a brief sense of relief because it appeared Diaz would surrender peacefully, \nand no one would get hurt. The officers walked along the ramp in front of the clubhouse, \ncontinuing their approach toward Diaz. Officer Mutter saw several people standing behind \nthe pillars at the front of the clubhouse. To Officer Mutter’s left were Officer Campa and \nSergeant McLane. The officers fanned out, getting in between Diaz and the clubhouse. \nOfficer Mutter wanted to get between Diaz and the clubhouse because he did not know \nDiaz’s intentions. Officer Mutter saw that Officers Stein and Jones had joined the officers \non the green as they approached Diaz.  \n \nTo reach Diaz, the officers had to traverse a large putting green. There was no cover or \nconcealment between Diaz and the officers. Officer Mutter held his rifle at the high-ready \nposition, pointed to Diaz, and looked over his optics as they walked toward Diaz. The \nofficers continued giving Diaz commands. Diaz dropped his right hand down to his side, \nout of Officer Mutter’s view, and lowered his left hand, parallel with his shoulder, as if he \nwas “complying with that one arm having it in the air, but in the meantime, his right hand \nwas down moving around” out of Officer Mutter’s view. Officer Mutter ordered Diaz to \n“stop reaching, stop reaching, don’t grab it.” Sergeant McLane was also giving Diaz \ncommands, so Officer Mutter stopped giving commands to avoid confusing Diaz. \n \nStill on his knees, Diaz then “kind of like almost falls to his right side and onto the ground, \nlike he’s kind of laying on his elbow,” still facing toward the officers. Diaz’s left hand was \nstill up, but his right hand was out of sight and appeared to be reaching for something on \nthe ground. Officer Mutter could not see what Diaz was reaching for, but based on the \ninformation he had received, he believed Diaz was reaching for a gun. Officer Mutter told \nDiaz, “Don’t reach, don’t reach!” Diaz turned from a side laying position onto his buttocks \nand back, and then Officer Mutter saw Diaz’s right hand come up holding a black semi-\nautomatic handgun. Diaz swung the handgun over and pointed it at Officer Mutter. Officer \nMutter was terrified and thought, “This guy’s gonna shoot out with me; he wants to kill \nme.” To stop the threat posed by Diaz, Officer Mutter fired his rifle at Diaz, who was 15 to \n20 yards away, aiming for his center mass/torso area. Officer Mutter fired in rapid \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 15 \n \n \nsuccession and believed he fired five to seven rounds in a southwest direction. Officer \nMutter stopped firing when Diaz fell onto his back with his arms out to the side of his body \nand was no longer pointing a gun at him.  \n \nThe officers approached Diaz. Officer Mutter saw that Diaz’s black handgun was lying on \nthe green next to Diaz, so he kept his rifle pointed at Diaz until he was confident Diaz was \nno longer able to pick the gun back up to shoot the officers. Diaz had fallen onto the \nground at the curb line of the cart path, so Sergeant McLane and another officer moved \nDiaz onto the grass, where they began administering medical assistance. The officers \nimmediately called for medical aid to respond. Officer Mutter saw a second gun in Diaz’s \npocket. While officers tended to Diaz’s injuries, Officer Mutter checked downrange from \nwhere the officers had fired to make sure no one had been hurt, and no houses had been \nhit by gunfire. Officer Mutter walked back to the scene and saw additional officers had \narrived. Officer Mutter told the officers about the golfers he had seen running north \nthrough the driving range because he knew they had probably witnessed what had \nhappened. Officer Mutter then waited in the parking lot to be transported back to the police \nstation. \n \nOn August 30, 2023, Officer Tyrell Jones was interviewed by Detectives Francisco \nDemara and Nicholas Paslak of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Officer Jones was on duty, assigned to the day shift patrol. Officer \nJones had been a police officer for eight weeks and was in field training. Officer Jones’ \nfield training officer was Officer Leonard Sein, who rode along with him in the patrol unit.  \n \nOfficers Jones and Sein were handling a theft call at Kohl’s on Summit Avenue, north of \nthe 210 freeway in Fontana, when dispatch aired a call for service regarding a male who \nhad fired two gunshots inside a residence at the Sierra Lakes Golf Course.7 Officer Jones \nwas not familiar with the area but was assisted by Officer Sein. Officer Jones activated \nhis patrol unit’s lights and sirens and headed to the location. While driving to the golf \ncourse, Officer Jones listened to dispatch as it updated details regarding the call for \nservice. Dispatch advised that the male had left the residence with two firearms. Upon \nhearing this, Officer Jones was concerned about an active shooter situation because the \nmale had geared up with more than one firearm. Officer Jones then heard dispatch advise \nthat the male was an off-duty sheriff’s deputy. This news increased Officer Jones’ stress \nlevel because it meant the male suspect was trained in firearms tactics. Dispatch advised \nthe male was wearing a gray shirt and black pants. \n \nOfficer Jones parked on the south side of the clubhouse. The parking lot was nearly full, \nwith only a few parking spaces open on the south end. Seeing so many people at the golf \ncourse and knowing the suspect was a trained law enforcement officer, Officer Jones \nfeared they might be facing an active shooter situation. Upon exiting his patrol unit, Officer \nJones saw Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officer Mutter armed with rifles \n \n7 Officer Jones was not using the Live 911 system, so he did not hear the 911 call. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 16 \n \n \nwalking across the putting green, west of the clubhouse, toward an individual on his knees \njust outside the putting green. Officer Jones heard his partners yelling commands at the \nindividual (later identified through investigation as Diaz) to “Show me your hands, show \nme your hands!” Officer Jones ran to catch up to his partners. Officer Jones saw several \ncivilians at the clubhouse beside the putting green. \n \nDiaz wore a gray shirt and black pants, matching the description aired by dispatch. Diaz \nfaced the officers, held his left hand up, palm flat, and waved at the officers as if to wave \nthem off. Officer Jones saw the handle of a black handgun in a black holster on Diaz’s \nwaistband. Officer Jones drew his firearm and pointed it at Diaz. As the officers walked \ntoward Diaz, Diaz kept his left hand in the air but reached with his right hand toward the \nground beside him as if trying to find something on the ground. Officer Jones saw a black \nhandgun on the ground next to Diaz, near his knee. The officers gave Diaz repeated \ncommands to show his hands. Diaz ignored the commands. Diaz continued reaching with \nhis right hand for the firearm on the ground but kept missing it because, instead of looking \nat the ground, Diaz looked at the officers and glanced to his left and right. Diaz was \n“mumbling,” and Officer Jones could not understand what he said. \n \nOfficer Jones headed northwest. To Officer Jones’ left were Officer Sein, Officer Mutter, \nSergeant McLane, and Corporal Campa. The officers began walking across the putting \ngreen toward Diaz as a team. There was no cover or concealment between the officers \nand Diaz. As they approached Diaz, the officers gave multiple orders to Diaz, telling him \nnot to grab the firearm and to show his hands. Officer Jones kept his handgun pointed at \nDiaz, looking alternatively over his gun’s sights and through his gun’s sights as he \napproached Diaz. Officer Jones was scared because Diaz was not following any of their \norders and continued reaching for the gun on the ground. Diaz kept his head up and \nlooked to his left and right while reaching toward the gun on the ground with his right \nhand, repeatedly missing it. This scared Officer Jones.  As the officers got closer to Diaz, \nOfficer Jones saw Diaz’s right hand touch the handgun on the ground and heard one of \nhis partners yell, “Don’t do it!  Don’t do it! Don’t do it!” Diaz grabbed the handle of the \nfirearm and turned onto his back. Diaz held his head up, looking straight toward Officer \nJones with the gun “slightly behind his shoulder.” Diaz then aimed the handgun at Officer \nJones and his partner, Officer Sein. Officer Jones was “absolutely terrified,” and knew he \ncould die. Officer Jones fired four to five rounds at Diaz’s center of mass to stop the threat. \nOfficer Jones stopped firing when Diaz fell onto his back, with both arms out to his side \nand dropped the firearm. Diaz’s gun landed beneath Diaz’s right armpit. \n \nThe officers approached Diaz. Sergeant McLane took the firearm from beneath Diaz’s \narmpit and moved it away from Diaz. Officer Jones holstered his handgun and helped \nSergeant McLane move Diaz onto the grass. Officer Jones used a towel to “plug up holes” \nin Diaz’s abdomen to try to stop the bleeding. Officer Jones initiated CPR while another \nofficer held the towels in place to control the bleeding. Medics arrived within about two \nminutes and took over Diaz’s medical care.     \n \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 17 \n \n \nOn September 6, 2023, Officer Leonard Sein was interviewed by Detectives Nicholas \nPaslak and Justin Carty of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Officer Sein was on duty, assigned as a field training officer to Officer \nJones on the day shift patrol. As a field training officer, Officer Sein supervised Officer \nJones and guided him as a trainee police officer. At about 3:45 p.m., Officers Sein and \nJones were taking a theft report at Kohl’s on Summit Avenue when they heard the triple \ntone (emergency in progress) from dispatch. Dispatch advised that a woman had called \nto report her husband had just fired a gunshot inside their residence. Dispatch advised \nthat the husband (later identified as Diaz) had walked away from the residence and was \nheaded toward the Sierra Lakes Golf Course. Officer Sein told Officer Jones to start \nheading toward the golf course, less than a quarter mile from the reporting party’s home. \nAs they drove to the scene code three (emergency lights and sirens), dispatch provided \nupdates regarding the call. Dispatch alerted responding officers that Diaz was reportedly \nan off-duty police officer, and according to his son, Diaz had taken two firearms with him \nwhen he left the house. \n \nBased on his training and experience, Officer Sein knew that public places with soft \nsecurity were common targets for active shooters. Knowing that Diaz had already fired a \ngunshot in his house and was now walking toward the golf course with two guns, Officer \nSein believed they would be facing an active shooter. Having golfed at the Sierra Lakes \nGolf Course many times, Officer Sein was “very familiar” with the location and knew \nmultiple people would be present during that time of day, both on the course and in the \nclubhouse. Officer Sein knew it was a dangerous situation with golfers likely drinking \nalcohol, which would decrease their level of awareness and affect their ability to notice \nand react to someone on the golf course armed with a gun.  \n \nOfficer Sein was anxious and feared for the safety of the public. Additionally, Officer Sein \nfeared for his own safety and that of his partner, a new officer who had not yet \nexperienced something like this in his career. Dispatch advised that Diaz had walked onto \nthe golf course with the firearms and was reportedly near “the starter.” Officer Sein knew \nthe starter was located southwest of the clubhouse. \n \nThe golf course parking lot was full when they arrived. Officers Sein and Jones parked \nfacing west in front of the front doors to the clubhouse. Sergeant McLane, Officer Mutter, \nand Corporal Campa had already arrived on scene and were exiting their patrol units. \nSergeant McLane, Officer Mutter, and Corporal Campa walked toward the starter with \ntheir rifles in hand. Officers Sein and Jones joined them. Officer Sein did not grab his rifle \nbecause Sergeant McLane, Officer Mutter, and Corporal Campa were already armed with \ntheir rifles. Because the officers believed they had an active shooter situation unfolding, \nit was an emergency, and as a result, they had no time to develop a tactical plan. Based \non their training, Officer Sein knew they needed to get to Diaz quickly. The five officers \nfanned out as they walked. Officer Sein veered off to his right, passing in front of the \nclubhouse but looking to his left toward the starter. In his periphery, Officer Sein saw \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 18 \n \n \npeople inside the clubhouse looking outside. In the distance, Officer Sein saw three \npeople near the driving range who looked like they had scattered or run away. \n \nOfficer Sein heard his partners begin to yell at a subject (Diaz) who was about 40 or 50 \nyards away. Diaz was on his knees, leaning down in front of a golf cart stopped beside \nthe curb on the “roundabout” cart path on the north side of the putting green. Diaz \nmatched the description given in the call and wore a gray shirt and black shorts. Officer \nSein “immediately started to approach [Diaz] off to the right of the other three officers,” \nwho moved toward Diaz.8 Officer Sein’s goal was to take Diaz into custody and to get him \nthe help he needed. The clubhouse was directly behind the officers as they made their \napproach. Officer Sein held his handgun with both hands extended out toward Diaz. Diaz \nfaced south. Diaz held his left hand up in the air but concealed his right hand. It looked \nlike Diaz “was trying to grab for something with his right hand” in the grass on the putting \ngreen on the other side of the curb. Diaz looked at the officers, then back behind himself, \nand then back at the officers, and behind himself again multiple times. The officers were \nabout 20 yards from Diaz.  \n \nOfficer Sein could not see what Diaz was reaching for but, based on the reports detailed \nin the call for service, believed Diaz was reaching for a firearm to use against the officers. \nOfficer Sein yelled at Diaz, “Don’t do it, don’t do it.” At that moment, Diaz rolled over onto \nhis back and “kind of sits upright” and pointed a black handgun directly at Officer Sein. \nOfficer Sein “absolutely knew that it was a firearm.” Diaz held the gun with one hand \nextended out straight from his body. There was no cover or concealment between Diaz \nand the officers. The clubhouse was directly behind Officer Sein. When Diaz pointed the \ngun at him, Officer Sein feared for his life, the lives of his partners, and the public. Officer \nSein believed Diaz was going to use the gun to kill them. To stop the threat, Officer Sein \nfired his Glock 22 .40 caliber handgun at Diaz, aiming for his center mass/torso area. \nOfficer Sein was about 15 to 20 yards from Diaz when he fired. Officer Sein fired in rapid \nsuccession and stopped firing when Diaz had fallen onto his back and was no longer \npointing the gun at them. Officer Sein believed he fired seven to eight rounds but learned \nduring the round count on his pistol that he had fired nine rounds. Officer Sein believed \nthe other officers, including Officer Jones, who stood right next to Officer Sein, also fired \ntheir guns at Diaz. \n \nThe officers quickly approached Diaz and began rendering medical attention. The officers \nput a tourniquet on Diaz’s right leg. Officer Sein noticed that Diaz had no pulse, so he \nstarted giving chest compressions until another unidentified officer took over and relieved \nhim. As the other officer gave Diaz chest compressions, Officer Sein saw the gun that \nDiaz had pointed at him on the ground off to Diaz’s side. Officer Sein saw the butt of a \nsecond handgun sticking out of Diaz’s left pocket and directed another officer to grab the \ngun and put it off to the side. Additional officers arrived, as did medics, and the involved \nshooting officers were transported back to the police station. \n \n \n8 Officer Jones was to the right of Officer Sein. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 19 \n \n \nSTATEMENTS BY CIVILIAN WITNESSES9 \n \nOn August 15, 2023, at approximately 8:56 p.m., Witness #2 was interviewed by \nDetective Francisco Demara of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Witness #2 was working in the clubhouse as the Food and Beverage \nDirector at Sierra Lakes Golf Course. At about 3:51 p.m.,10 Witness #2 went outside to \nstraighten the Sunday brunch sign and saw a man (later identified as Diaz) walking toward \nthe clubhouse’s delivery gate. Diaz “looked weird, like he was on something.” It was not \nuncommon for homeless people to walk onto the golf course, and Witness #2 thought \nDiaz was a homeless person because his “movement was off.” Diaz pointed toward the \ndelivery gate, and Witness #2 noticed Diaz had a black pistol in his hand. Diaz appeared \nto be talking to himself and, at times, would point the gun outward like he was going to \nshoot. As soon as Witness #2 saw Diaz had a gun, Witness #2 went back inside and \nlocked the doors. Customers were inside, so Witness #2 warned them about what he had \nseen. Witness #2 ran over to the pro shop11 to tell his coworkers to lock the doors because \nthere was a man outside with a gun. Witness #2 then went to the lounge/bar area of the \nclubhouse and told his coworkers to lock the doors because there was a man with a gun \noutside. A customer was trying to come inside, but the door was locked, so after making \nsure the man was not with Diaz, Witness #2 unlocked the door to let him inside. Witness \n#2 told the customer, “Hey, just get in here, there’s a guy with a gun.” \n \nInside the clubhouse, Witness #2’s coworkers and the customers looked out the windows \ntoward the putting green. Witness #2 heard someone say, “He’s by the putting green,” \nand, “The cops are already here.” Witness #2 heard about 10 to 12 gunshots but did not \nsee the shooting because he was still ensuring that he had locked all the doors and was \nnot focusing on what was happening outside. After the shooting, Witness #2 looked out \nthe window and saw the police administering CPR to Diaz. \n \nOn August 15, 2023, at approximately 8:28 p.m., Witness #3 was interviewed by \nDetectives Francisco Demara and Nicolas Craig of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s \nDepartment. \n \nWitness #3 arrived at Sierra Lakes Golf Course to golf during the afternoon of August 15, \n2023. Witness #3 did not recall the exact time. When Witness #3 arrived, the pro \nshop/clubhouse doors were locked. An employee let Witness #3 inside and told him there \nwas a man outside with a gun. Other people were inside the pro shop, huddled by a door, \nwatching out the windows. Witness #3 heard someone say, “There he is.” Witness #3 \nsaw a man (Diaz) outside with a gun, wearing a grey shirt. Diaz was very sweaty and \nappeared to be breathing heavily. Diaz was fidgety and seemed confused like he was \n \n9 Investigators interviewed more than 25 civilian witnesses, most of whom were present at Sierra Lakes Golf Course \nat the time of the incident under review. All interviews were reviewed, although not all are summarized here. \n10 Witness #2 knew the time because he noted it when reviewing the surveillance footage after the incident.  \n11 The pro shop and clubhouse were housed in the same building. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 20 \n \n \npossibly on drugs. Diaz pointed a gun at an employee who was outside wearing a hat. \nDiaz then held the gun downward and walked toward the putting green toward two parked \ngolf carts. Diaz leaned against the golf cart parked closest to the clubhouse like he was \nresting. Diaz then went to the ground and put the gun down on the ground. \n \nWitness #3 saw the police arrive about 10 to 15 seconds before Diaz leaned against the \ngolf cart. The police had their weapons drawn and appeared to be talking to Diaz. Diaz \npicked the gun up as the officers yelled, “Don’t do it! Don’t do it!”  Diaz “rolled on the \nground” and then “waved” the gun at the officers like he was going to shoot, and the \nofficers fired their weapons at him. Witness #3 heard at least 10 to 15 gunshots. Witness \n#3 estimated the officers were five to 10 feet away from Diaz when they fired. Witness #3 \nwas not sure if Diaz fired his gun, but he did not see Diaz fire. Witness #3 recorded the \nofficer-involved shooting with his cell phone. \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Witness #4 was interviewed by Detective John Collopy of the \nFontana Police Department. \n \nWitness #4 was at the first hole tee box at the beginning of the course, which was located \ndown a small hill near the clubhouse by the practice putting green.12 A short distance \nfrom the first hole tee box was a podium where the “starter” stood. The “starter” was an \nemployee of the golf course who helps keep golfers moving with their reservations. \nWitness #4 was taking practice swings when he heard the starter yell, “He has a gun! He \nhas a gun!” Witness #4 saw a man walking near the podium where the starter stood. The \nman was carrying something but Witness #4 could not tell if it was a gun. Witness #4’s \nfriend yelled out, “He has a gun,” so Witness #4 ran to his golf cart. Witness #4’s friend \nand his wife also ran to their golf cart. Witness #4 and his friends drove their carts down \nthe course to get away from the man with the gun. As they drove away, Witness #4 looked \nback and saw the man sit down on the ground at the top of the hill near the starter podium. \n \nOnce Witness #4 got to the end of the first hole, he stopped. Witness #4 saw the man \nstand up and run toward the practice putting green and out of sight. Soon after, Witness \n#4 saw police arrive. Witness #4 could no longer see the man with a gun, but he heard \napproximately six to seven rapid-fire gunshots. Witness #4 could not describe the man \nbecause everything happened very quickly. \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Witness #5 was interviewed by Detective Justin Moyer of the \nFontana Police Department. \n \nWitness #5 was an employee at Sierra Lakes Golf Course and was working as a \nbartender. Witness #5’s manager came in and said, “Lock the doors,” and told him there \nwas someone there with a gun. Witness #5 saw a man walking to the putting green with \na handgun in his hand. The man was pointing the gun around and looked like he was \ntrying to hide. Witness #5 saw the man at the putting green when four to five police officers \n \n12 The officer-involved shooting occurred on the practice putting green. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 21 \n \n \n“came around the corner.” Initially, the man was on his knees with his hands up and \nappeared to be listening to the officers’ commands, but as the officers approached the \nman, he “hesitated” and went to pick his gun back up. According to Witness #5, it looked \nlike the man picked the gun up and “kind of rolled” and then pointed the gun at the officers \nbefore they shot him.  \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Witness #6 was interviewed by Detective Justin Moyer of the \nFontana Police Department. \n \nWitness #6 was an employee of the Sierra Lakes Golf Course and was inside the main \noffice when she heard someone yelling, “Fuck this.” Witness #6 heard someone banging \non the office door and yell, “Fuck, fuck, fuck!” The person sounded like he was drunk. \nWitness #6 looked outside her window and saw the man with his back against the \nbuilding, pointing his gun toward the parking lot. The man kept yelling, “Just fucking take \nit already, just take it already!” Witness #6’s impression was that the man was arguing \nwith himself. Witness #6 hid at that point and did not see or hear anything else.   \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Witness #7 was interviewed by Deputy Andrew Davis of the \nFontana Police Department. \n \nWitness #7 was golfing at Sierra Lakes Golf Course when he heard someone say, “He’s \ngot a gun.” Witness #7 looked around and saw a man who yelled, “Help me, someone is \nafter me!” The man raised his right hand while holding a black Glock-style handgun. \nWitness #7 began running northbound through the golf course. Witness #7 then heard \nseveral gunshots.  \n \nOn August 15, 2023, Witness #8 was interviewed by Deputy Corey Garcia of the Fontana \nPolice Department. \n \nWitness #8 was golfing at Sierra Lakes Golf Course and standing near the ball dispenser \non the putting green, wearing his earbuds to focus on his golf game. Witness #8 saw ten \npeople running west toward the 18th hole and heard someone yell, “He has a gun!” \nWitness #8 ran south through the putting green, past an open sidewalk area, and west \ntoward the driving range. Witness #8 hid behind a large yellow “golf target” on the grass. \nWitness #8 saw five police officers walking toward the golf carts parked at the putting \ngreen, where a man was down on the ground. Witness #8 heard the officers say, “Drop \nthe weapon,” approximately five to six times. The officers walked with guns and yelled, \n“Don’t do it!” approximately three to five times. Witness #8 heard about 10 to 15 gunshots \nand then saw the officers point their firearms down toward the ground. The officers \nimmediately began to render medical aid and CPR to the man who had been shot. \n \nINCIDENT AUDIO AND VIDEO13 \n \n13 All videos submitted were reviewed in their entirety. The summaries will cover the events from the beginning \nthrough the point immediately after the incident under review. Due to the distance of the cameras from the subjects, \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 22 \n \n \n \n911 Calls \n \nWitness #1 called 911 at about 3:48 p.m. The duration of the call was six minutes, 39 \nseconds. When the 911 operator answered the call, Witness #1 asked the operator to \n“dispatch police” to her residence and provided her address. The operator asked Witness \n#1 what the emergency was. Witness #1 replied, “My husband just threw [unintelligible] \nin the house, but he left, and I don’t even know where he’s at.”  The operator asked, “He \nthrew a what?” Witness #1, out of breath, apologized and explained that she “didn’t know \nhow to put it.” Witness #1 repeatedly and breathlessly asked, “Where did he go?” and \nsaid she didn’t know where he went. The operator again asked Witness #1 what her \nhusband threw, and Witness #1 did not answer. Instead, Witness #1 said, “Oh my God, \nwhere did he go.” The operator persisted, asking Witness #1 again, “What did he throw?” \nWitness #1 replied, “Oh, I don’t even know how to say it. He has two guns and he shoot \nthe gun inside the house, and he left, but I don’t even know where he left.” Witness #1 \nbreathed hard and rapidly and had difficulty speaking.  \n \nEventually, the operator was able to gather more information from Witness #1. Witness \n#1 provided a description of what Diaz was wearing and advised that he left the house on \nfoot, carrying his gun. Witness #1 explained that Diaz was upset and believed someone \nwas going to kill him. Witness #1 told the operator that Diaz was “having an episode.” \nWitness #1 told the operator that Diaz was “off duty” and was a deputy with the Los \nAngeles County Sheriff’s Department, and that she believed the gun he had was his duty \nweapon. During the phone call, Diaz’s son got on the phone and advised that Diaz was \nhaving a “manic episode,” Diaz was convinced someone was “in the walls” of the house \nand was “trying to kill him,” and that Diaz possessed two guns when he left the house. \nThe 911 operator provided the information gathered during the 911 call to the officers. \n \nAdditional 911 Calls \n \nAt about 3:54 p.m., multiple witnesses began calling 911 to report a man with a gun at \nSierra Lakes Golf course. One caller advised there was a man with a gun walking down \nthe street waving a gun around on Medinah, off Colonial Drive, heading toward the golf \ncourse. Callers variously described the man with the gun as running around the golf \ncourse, in front of the pro shop, at the starter’s box, and near the parking lot. Callers \nprovided a physical description of Diaz and advised he was wearing a grey shirt and black \nshorts and reported the man was yelling. Some callers were unable to provide a \ndescription, explaining that they ran away when they saw the man with a gun. \n \nAs the 911 calls continued to come in, the dispatch operators began answering the calls \nand immediately asking if the caller was reporting a man with a gun at the golf course. \n \nstill images displayed herein may not capture the entire image and are instead focused on the subjects. Surveillance \nvideos from the golf course did not contain audio. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 23 \n \n \nSirens could be heard in the background of the phone calls and the operators assured \nthe callers that officers were on scene. \n \nSurveillance Videos \n \nSurveillance cameras from the area surrounding the Diaz home recorded Diaz carrying \ntwo black semi-automatic handguns, one in each hand. Diaz yelled loudly and cursed. \nWhile at Sierra Lakes Golf Course, Diaz jogged around the golf course and the clubhouse \npatios carrying a black semi-automatic handgun in his right hand. Diaz held onto the left \nside of his waistband with his left hand. A large, heavy object appeared to be in the left \npocket of Diaz’s black shorts. Diaz seemed to be breathing heavily and was sweating \nprofusely, saturating his gray shirt.  \n \nSeveral employees and golfers were present at the golf course; some appeared unaware \nof Diaz’s presence, while others were clearly aware of the danger, as shown by their facial \nexpressions and reactions, running, and hiding, upon seeing Diaz with a gun. An \nemployee driving a golf cart jumped out of the still-moving cart and ran away from Diaz. \nAs Diaz scurried around the golf course property, he turned his head, looking in multiple \ndirections, and appeared to take cover behind pillars and other objects. Diaz pointed the \ngun outward numerous times as if perceiving a threat but did not appear to fire it until the \nofficer-involved shooting. Diaz attempted to open locked doors to the clubhouse and the \nmanager’s office. Golf course surveillance videos recorded all five officers as they arrived \non scene. The golf course surveillance cameras did not face the putting green where the \nofficer-involved shooting occurred. \n \nCell Phone Video \n \nWitness #3 recorded the officer-involved shooting with his cell phone from inside the \nclubhouse/pro shop through the west facing windows overlooking the putting green. The \nvideo length was one minute, seven seconds.14 \n \n0:00:00 – 0:00:11 The video showed the putting green in the distance beyond the west \nclubhouse patio. Multiple people could be heard speaking inside the clubhouse, their \nvoices overlapping. A golf cart was parked on the patio between the clubhouse and the \nputting green, partially obstructing the camera view of the officers as they walked on the \nputting green toward two white golf carts parked on the cart path beside the putting green. \nAs the camera focus zoomed in, Diaz could be seen on his knees beside the rear driver’s \nside of the golf cart parked on the cart path nearest the clubhouse. Diaz faced in a \nsouthwest direction, away from the officers. \n \n \n14 Reference times are from the media player.  \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 24 \n \n \n \n \n0:00:11 to 0:00:13 Diaz turned his head to the left and raised his left hand into the air as \nthe officers advanced toward him with their guns drawn and aimed in his direction. Diaz’s \nright arm was not visible from the camera’s view.  \n \n0:00:13 to 0:00:21 The officers walked toward the cart path, still aiming their firearms at \nDiaz. Two officers continued walking toward the cart path, out of camera view. Diaz, still \nholding his left hand in the air, twisted his torso to the right and reached toward the ground \nbehind him as if trying to pick up an unseen object on the ground. Three additional officers \ncame into camera view walking on the putting green toward Diaz. A person inside the \nclubhouse said, “They got him.” Diaz lowered his left hand and twisted his torso further to \nthe right as he grabbed for an object on the ground with his right hand.  \n \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 25 \n \n \n \n \n0:00:21 to 0:00:24 Diaz maneuvered from a kneeling position onto his right hip and side \nwith his right elbow and right hand on the ground. Diaz quickly turned his torso toward the \nofficers, raising his left hand. Diaz promptly sat up and pointed a black handgun at the \nofficers with his right hand. \n \n \n \n0:00:24 to 0:00:25 A male voice from inside the clubhouse said, “Oh, he’s got a—” before \nbeing interrupted by the sound of multiple gunshots as the officers began to fire their \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 26 \n \n \nweapons at Diaz. The male voice then cursed loudly. Expelled gasses from the officers’ \nhandguns could be seen as they fired.  \n \n0:00:25 to 0:00:28 Diaz fell backward with his right hand holding the pistol in the air above \nhis head. Diaz’s right hand moved as the handgun recoiled.15 Fired bullets from the \nofficers’ guns struck the ground around Diaz. Gunfire ended.  \n \n0:00:28 to 0:00:39 Multiple people inside the clubhouse commented on the shooting and \nsaid repeatedly, “Oh fuck,” and “He grabbed the gun.” The officers quickly approached \nDiaz who was on his back on the edge of the putting green and cart path. The officers \ncarried Diaz onto the grass and began rendering aid. The remainder of the video showed \nthe officers tending to Diaz. \n \nBODY-WORN CAMERA VIDEO16 \n \nSergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein activated their \nbody-worn cameras prior to the officer-involved shooting. All body-worn camera footage \nrecorded audio, except for Officer Jones’ footage, which did not record audio due to a \nmalfunction.  \n \nOfficer Sein’s Body-Worn Camera Video \n \n00:00 to 00:30 Officer Sein ran in a north, northwest direction past the clubhouse toward \nthe putting green. Officer Sein’s partners were captured on video as they walked across \nthe putting green, guns pointed in a northwest direction and yelling commands at Diaz. \nThe officers ordered Diaz not to reach for anything and repeatedly told Diaz, “Don’t do it,” \nand “Don’t do it, bud. Calm down.” The distance between Officer Sein and Diaz, combined \nwith dark shadows from multiple bushes and trees, make it difficult to see Diaz until the \n00:28 second mark, when Officer Sein was positioned closer to Diaz. Diaz was on his \nknees beside a golf cart, but due to the dark shadows and video quality, it is unclear what \nDiaz was doing.  \n \n00:30 to 00:33 The officers continued giving commands to Diaz as they advanced toward \nhim. Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officer Mutter were to Officer Sein’s left. \nAs Officer Sein moved closer to the cart path and Diaz, Sergeant McLane, Corporal \nCampa, and Officer Mutter were lost from camera view. Officer Jones was to the right of \nOfficer Sein.   \n \n \n15 During the scene investigation, two black handguns registered to Diaz (a Smith and Wesson 9mm M&P Shield and \na Glock 45, 9mm handgun) and four “WIN 9mm Luger” fired cartridge casings were found on the ground where Diaz \nhad been during the shooting. \n16 The officers were equipped with Visual Labs body-worn cameras which were mounted in the torso area. Times \nnoted are from the media player bar. All body-worn camera videos were reviewed in their entirety though not at all \nsummarized herein. \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 27 \n \n \n00:33 to 00:34 Diaz abruptly turned his torso to the right, away from Officers Sein and \nJones. Unknown officers yelled, “Hey!” Officer Sein yelled, “Don’t do it!” as he raised his \nhandgun in a two-handed grip and pointed it at Diaz. Officer Jones, to the right of Officer \nSein, pointed his handgun at Diaz. Multiple officers yelled, “Don’t do it! Don’t do it! Don’t \ndo it!”  \n \nTimestamp 00:34 \n \n00:34 to 00:37 As the officers yelled, “Don’t do it,” Diaz rolled onto his side, leaned \nbackward and then sat up on his buttocks facing the officers. Diaz then swung his right \nhand from behind his body and pointed a handgun at the officers.  \n \n00:37 to 00:40 Officer Sein fired his handgun at Diaz. Gunfire from the other officers’ \nfirearms rang out. Officer Sein fired his weapon approximately nine times. At the time the \ngunshots were fired by officers, Diaz was positioned on his buttocks and began leaning \nbackward. Due to the gases expelled from Officer Sein’s handgun, Diaz’s hands cannot \nbe seen. All gunfire ceased at the 00:40 mark.  \n \n00:40 to 01:05 Officer Sein began approaching Diaz. Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, \nand Officer Mutter came into camera view from Officer Sein’s right, also approaching \nDiaz. Officer Sein announced, “I’ve got radio, I’ve got radio.” Officer Sein announced that \nshots had been fired and requested medical aid. The officers approached Diaz, who lay \non his back partly on the cart path, partly on the green. The officers moved Diaz onto the \ngreen and began administering medical aid. \n \n \n \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 28 \n \n \nCorporal Campa’s and Sergeant McLane’s Body-Worn Camera Video \n \nCorporal Campa’s and Sergeant McLane’s’ body-worn cameras did not clearly capture \nthe officer-involved shooting due to the camera position on the officers’ tactical vests and \ntheir shooting platform. However, their body-worn cameras did record the commands the \nofficers gave as they moved across the putting green toward Diaz. When Corporal Campa \nreached the putting green, he pointed ahead and asked, “What’s up bro? This guy?” \nSergeant McLane calmly commanded, “Show us your hands, bro. Show us your hands. \nShow us your hands. Put your hands up, bro. Don’t reach for nothing, bro. Don’t reach \nfor nothing, man.” Corporal Campa said, “Don’t do it, dude,” followed by “Hand, hand, \nhand, hand!” Corporal Campa said, “Watch for his hand,” and “Don’t do it, dude. Keep \nyour hands up, keep your hands up, keep your hands up. Don’t do it.”  Corporal Campa \nthen said, “Hey, hey, don’t do it.” Additional unknown officers yelled, “Don’t do it.” As the \nofficers repeatedly yelled, “Don’t do it,” Diaz briefly came into Corporal Campa’s body-\nworn camera view.

(Calif. Penal C. §835a(b).) 17 \nShould an arresting officer encounter resistance, actual or threatened, he need not retreat \nfrom his effort and maintains his right to self-defense. (Penal C. §835a(d).) An officer may \nuse objectively reasonable force to effect an arrest, prevent escape or overcome \nresistance. (Penal C. §835a(d).)  \n \nAn arrestee has a duty to refrain from using force or any weapon to resist arrest, if he \nknows or should know that he is being arrested. (Penal C. §834a.) This duty remains \neven if the arrest is determined to have been unlawful. (People v. Coffey (1967) 67 Cal.2d \n204, 221.) In the interest of orderly resolution of disputes between citizens and the \ngovernment, a detainee also has a duty to refrain from using force to resist detention or \nsearch. (Evans v. City of Bakersfield (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 21, 332-333.) An arrestee or \n \n17 All references to code sections here pertain to the California Penal Code.  \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 33 \n \n \ndetainee may be kept in an officer’s presence by physical restraint, threat of force, or \nassertion of the officer’s authority. (In re Gregory S. (1980) 112 Cal. App. 3d 764, 778, \nciting, In re Tony C. (1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 895.) The force used by the officer to effectuate \nthe arrest or detention can be justified if it satisfies the Constitutional test in Graham v. \nConnor (1989) 490 U.S. 386, 395. (People v. Perry (2019) 36 Cal. App. 5th 444, 469-\n470.)   \n \nAn officer-involved shooting may be justified as a matter of self-defense, which is codified \nin Penal Code at §§196 and 197. Both code sections are pertinent to the analysis of the \nconduct involved in this review and are discussed below. \n \nPENAL CODE SECTION 196.  Police officers may use deadly force in the course of their \nduties, under circumstances not available to members of the general public. Penal Code \n§196 states that homicide by a public officer is justifiable when it results from a use of \nforce that “is in compliance with Section 835a.” Section 835a specifies a police officer \nis justified in using deadly force when he reasonably believes based upon the totality \nof the circumstances, that it is necessary: \n \n(1) \nto defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to \nthe officer or another, or  \n \n(2) \nto apprehend a fleeing felon who threatened or caused death or serious \nbodily injury, if the officer also reasonably believes that the fleeing felon \nwould cause further death or serious bodily injury unless immediately \napprehended. \n \n(Penal C. §835a(c)(1).)  \n \nDischarge of a firearm is “deadly force.” (Penal C. §835a(e)(1).) The “‘[t]otality of the \ncircumstances’ means all facts known to the peace officer at the time, including the \nconduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of deadly force.” (Penal C. \n§835a(e)(3).) A peace officer need not retreat or desist from efforts to arrest a resistant \narrestee. (Penal C. §834a(d).) A peace officer is neither deemed the aggressor in this \ninstance, nor does he lose the right of self-defense by the use of objectively reasonable \nforce to effect the arrest, prevent escape or overcome resistance. (Id.) \n \nWhile the appearance of these principals was new to section 835a in 2020,18 the courts \nhave been defining the constitutional parameters of use of deadly force for many years. \nIn 1985, the United States Supreme Court held that when a police officer has probable \ncause to believe that the suspect he is attempting to apprehend “has committed a crime \ninvolving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm” to the officer or \nothers, using deadly force to prevent escape is not constitutionally unreasonable.  \n(Tennessee v. Garner (1985) 471 U.S. 1, 11-12.) California courts have held that when a \n \n18 Assem. Bill No. 392 (2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) approved by the Governor, August 19, 2019. [Hereinafter “AB-392”] \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 34 \n \n \npolice officer’s actions are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment of our national \nConstitution, that the requirements of Penal Code § 196 are also satisfied.  (Martinez v. \nCounty of Los Angeles (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 334, 349; Witness #6 v. Grinder (E.D. Cal., \nJan. 22, 2019) 2019 WL 280296, at *25.) There is also a vast body of caselaw that has \ndemonstrated how to undertake the analysis of what is a reasonable use of force under \nthe totality of the circumstances. (See Reasonableness discussion, infra.) As such, our \npre-2020 state caselaw, developed upon the former iteration of section 196, is still \ninstructive.  \n \nThere are two new factors in section 835a that did not appear in the section previously, \nnor did they develop in caselaw pertaining to use of deadly force. First, a peace officer \nmust make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace officer and warn that \ndeadly force may be used, prior to using deadly force to affect arrest. (Penal C. \n§835a(c)(1).) This requirement will not apply if an officer has objectively reasonable \ngrounds to believe that the person to be arrested is aware of those facts. (Penal C. \n§835a(c)(1).)  Second, deadly force cannot be used against a person who only poses a \ndanger to themselves. (Penal C. §835a(c)(2).) \n \nWhile the codified standards for use of deadly force in the course of arrest are set forth \nat subsections (b) through (d) of Section 835a, the legislature also included findings and \ndeclarations at subsection (a). These findings and declarations lend guidance to our \nanalysis but are distinct from the binding standards that succeed them within the section. \nIn sum, the findings are as follows:  \n \n(1) \nthat the use of force should be exercised judiciously and with respect for \nhuman rights and dignity; that every person has a right to be free from \nexcessive uses of force;  \n \n(2) \nthat use of force should be used only when necessary to defend human \nlife and peace officers shall use de-escalation techniques if it is \nreasonable, safe and feasible to do so; \n \n(3) \nthat use of force incidents should be evaluated thoroughly with \nconsideration of gravity and consequence, lawfulness, and consistency \nwith agency policies;19  \n \n \n19 Penal C. §835a (a)(3) conflates a demand for thorough evaluation of a use of force incident with a dictate that it be \ndone “in order to ensure that officers use force consistent with law and agency policies.” On its face, the section is \nclumsily worded. Nothing included in AB-392 plainly requires that a use of force also be in compliance with agency \npolicies. A provision in the companion bill to AB-392—Senate Bill No. 230 [(2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) approved by the \nGovernor, September 12, 2019] (Hereinafter “SB-230”), does explicitly state that “[a law enforcement agency’s use \nof force policies and training] may be considered as a factor in the totality of circumstances in determining whether \nthe officer acted reasonably, but shall not be considered as imposing a legal duty on the officer to act in accordance \nwith such policies and training.” (Sen. Bill No. 230 (2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) §1.) It is noteworthy, however, that this \nportion of SB-230 is uncodified, unlike the aforementioned portion of Penal C. §835a (a)(3). \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 35 \n \n \n(4) \nthat the evaluation of use of force is based upon a totality of the \ncircumstances, from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same \nsituation; and  \n \n(5) \nthat those with disabilities may be affected in their ability to understand \nand comply with peace officer commands and suffer a greater instance of \nfatal encounters with law enforcement, therefore. \n \n(Penal C. §835a(a).)   \n \nPENAL CODE SECTION 197.  California law permits all persons to use deadly force to \nprotect themselves from the imminent threat of death or great bodily injury.  Penal Code \n§197 provides that the use of deadly force by any person is justifiable when used in self-\ndefense or in defense of others.  \n \nThe pertinent criminal jury instruction to this section is CALCRIM 505 (“Justifiable \nHomicide: Self-Defense or Defense of Another”).  The instruction, rooted in caselaw, \nstates that a person acts in lawful self-defense or defense of another if: \n \n(1) \nHe reasonably believed that he or someone else was in imminent danger \nof being killed or suffering great bodily injury; \n \n(2) \nHe reasonably believed that the immediate use of deadly force was \nnecessary to defend against that danger; and \n \n(3) \nHe used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against \nthat danger. \n \n(CALCRIM 505.)  The showing required under section 197 is principally equivalent to the \nshowing required under section 835a(c)(1), as stated supra. \n \nIMMINENCE.  “Imminence is a critical component” of self-defense.  (People v. Humphrey \n(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1073, 1094.) A person may resort to the use of deadly force in self-\ndefense, or in defense of another, where there is a reasonable need to protect oneself or \nsomeone else from an apparent, imminent threat of death or great bodily injury. “An \nimminent peril is one that, from appearances, must be instantly dealt with.”  (In re Christian \nS. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 768, 783.) The primary inquiry is whether action was instantly required \nto avoid death or great bodily injury.  (Humphrey, supra, 13 Cal.4th at 1088.) What a \nperson knows, and his actual awareness of the risks posed against him are relevant to \ndetermine if a reasonable person would believe in the need to defend. (Id. at 1083.) In \nthis regard, there is no duty to wait until an injury has been inflicted to be sure that deadly \nforce is indeed appropriate. (Scott v. Henrich, supra, 39 F. 3d at 915.)  \n \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 36 \n \n \nImminence more recently defined in the context of use of force to effect an arrest, is \nsimilar: \n \nA threat of death or serious bodily injury is “imminent” when, based on the totality \nof the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe \nthat a person has the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to \nimmediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or another \nperson. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future harm, no matter how \ngreat the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one that, \nfrom appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed. \n \n(Penal C. §835a(e)(2).) \n \nREASONABLENESS.  Self-defense requires both subjective honesty and objective \nreasonableness.  (People v. Aris (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1178, 1186.) The United States \nSupreme Court has held that an officer’s right to use force in the course of an arrest, stop \nor seizure, deadly or otherwise, must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment’s \n“reasonableness” standard. (Graham v. Connor, supra, 490 U.S. at 395.)   \nThe ‘reasonableness’ of a particular use of force must be judged from the \nperspective of a reasonable officer on scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of \nhindsight.... The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact \nthat police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments—in \ncircumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the amount \nof force that is necessary in a particular situation.  \n \n(Id. at 396-397, citations omitted.) \n \nThe “reasonableness” test requires an analysis of “whether the officers’ actions are \n‘objectively reasonable’ in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without \nregard to their underlying intent or motivation.”  (Id. at 397, citations omitted.) What \nconstitutes “reasonable” self-defense or defense of others is controlled by the \ncircumstances.  A person’s right of self-defense is the same whether the danger is real \nor merely apparent.  (People v. Jackson (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 639.)  If the person’s \nbeliefs were reasonable, the danger does not need to have actually existed. (CALCRIM \n505.)  Yet, a person may use no more force than is reasonably necessary to defend \nagainst the danger they face.  (CALCRIM 505.) \n \nWhen deciding whether a person’s beliefs were reasonable, a jury is instructed to \nconsider the circumstances as they were known to and appeared to the person and \nconsiders what a reasonable person in a similar situation with similar knowledge would \nhave believed.  (CALCRIM 505.) It was previously held that in the context of an officer-\ninvolved incident, this standard does not morph into a “reasonable police officer” \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 37 \n \n \nstandard. (People v. Mehserle (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1147.)20 To be clear, the \nofficer’s conduct should be evaluated as “the conduct of a reasonable person functioning \nas a police officer in a stressful situation.” (Id.) \n \nThe Graham court plainly stated that digestion of the “totality of the circumstances” is fact-\ndriven and considered on a case-by-case basis. (Graham v. Connor, supra, 490 U.S. at \n396.) As such, “reasonableness” cannot be precisely defined, nor can the test be \nmechanically applied. (Id.) Still, Graham does grant the following factors to be considered \nin the “reasonableness” calculus: the severity of the crime committed, whether the threat \nposed is immediate, whether the person seized is actively resisting arrest or attempting \nto flee to evade arrest. (Id.)  \n \nWhether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officer or others has \nbeen touted as the “most important” Graham factor. (Mattos v. Agarano (9th Cir. 2011) \n661 F.3d 433, 441-442.) The threatened use of a gun or knife, for example, is the sort \nof immediate threat contemplated by the United States Supreme Court, that \njustifies an officer’s use of deadly force. (Reynolds v. County of San Diego (9th Cir. \n1994) 858 F.Supp. 1064, 1071-72 “an officer may reasonably use deadly force when he \nor she confronts an armed suspect in close proximity whose actions indicate an intent to \nattack.”) Again, the specified factors of Graham were not meant to be exclusive; other \nfactors are taken into consideration when “necessary to account for the totality of the \ncircumstances in a given case.” (Mattos v. Agarano, supra, 661 F.3d at 441-442.) \n \nThe use of force policies and training of an involved officer’s agency may also be \nconsidered as a factor to determine whether the officer acted reasonably. (Sen. Bill No. \n230 (2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) §1. See fn. 3, infra.) \n \nWhen undertaking this analysis, courts do not engage in Monday Morning \nQuarterbacking, and nor shall we. Our state appellate court explains, \n \nUnder Graham we must avoid substituting our personal notions of proper police \nprocedure for the instantaneous decision of the officer at the scene.  We must \nnever allow the theoretical, sanitized world of our imagination to replace the \ndangerous and complex world that policemen face every day.  What constitutes \n‘reasonable’ action may seem quite different to someone facing a possible \nassailant than to someone analyzing the question at leisure. \n \n(Martinez v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 47 Cal.App.4th at 343, citing Smith v. Freland \n(6th Cir. 1992) 954 F.2d 343, 347.) Specifically, when a police officer reasonably believes \na suspect may be armed or arming himself, it does not change the analysis even if \n \n20 The legislative findings included in Penal C. section 835a(a)(4) suggest to the contrary that “the decision by a peace \nofficer to use force shall be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same situation”. As such, if \nthe officer using force was acting in an effort to effect arrest, as is governed by section 835a, then it appears the more \ngenerous standard included there would apply.  \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 38 \n \n \nsubsequent investigation reveals the suspect was unarmed.  (Baldridge v. City of Santa \nRosa (9th Cir. 1999) 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1414 *1, 27-28.) \n \nThe Supreme Court’s definition of reasonableness is, therefore, “comparatively generous \nto the police in cases where potential danger, emergency conditions or other exigent \ncircumstances are present.”  (Martinez v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 47 Cal.App.4th \nat 343-344, citing Roy v. Inhabitants of City of Lewiston (1st Cir. 1994) 42 F.3d 691, 695.) \nIn close-cases therefore, the Supreme Court will surround the police with a fairly wide \n“zone of protection” when the aggrieved conduct pertains to on-the-spot choices made in \ndangerous situations.  (Id. at 343-344.) One court explained that the deference given to \npolice officers (versus a private citizen) as follows: \n  \nUnlike private citizens, police officers act under color of law to protect the public \ninterest. They are charged with acting affirmatively and using force as part of their \nduties, because ‘the right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily \ncarries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof \nto effect it.’  \n \n(Munoz v. City of Union City (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1077, 1109, citing Graham v. Connor, \n[supra] 490 U.S. 386, 396.)  \n \nDE-ESCALATION \n \nDiaz was on a golf course where multiple civilians were present during a busy summer \nafternoon. The presence of civilians affected the officers' decision-making process, \nforcing them to take swift action to protect the public. The officers feared that Diaz would \nbecome an active shooter. Because the officers recognized this danger, they had no \nchoice but to locate and attempt to contain Diaz with haste.  \n \nUpon seeing Diaz near the putting green, Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, Officers \nMutter, Jones, and Sein approached him swiftly but with caution. Believing Diaz was \narmed with two handguns, the officers held their firearms in hand as they approached \nhim. Sergeant McLane immediately began giving Diaz commands to show his hands, to \nput his hands up, and not to reach for anything. \n \nSergeant McLane’s commands were loud, clear, and concise. The commands were \nsimple and easy to follow. Sergeant McLane repeatedly told Diaz to show his hands, to \nput his hands up, and not to reach for anything. Sergeant McLane repeated the \ncommands as the officers continued advancing toward Diaz. Though multiple officers \ngave commands, their commands were consistent with each other. The officers told Diaz \nprecisely what he needed to do: Keep his hands in the air and not reach for anything. \nThough Diaz held his left hand in the air as if to comply with the officers, Diaz actively \nsearched for his handgun with his right hand. Corporal Campa, who believed Diaz was \nreaching for a gun, warned his partners, telling them to watch Diaz's hand. Corporal \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 39 \n \n \nCampa then told Diaz, \"Don't do it, dude. Keep your hands up, keep your hands up!\" Diaz \nstill refused to comply and continued reaching for his gun. Corporal Campa repeated the \ncommands, yelling, \"Hey, hey! Don't do it!\" The other officers also yelled, \"Don't do it,\" \nmultiple times. \n \nBased on the body-worn camera video footage, the officers had less than 40 seconds \nfrom the time they first spotted Diaz before Diaz pointed a gun at them. Though the \nofficers had little time to de-escalate the situation, they gave Diaz multiple commands and \nattempted to gain his cooperation so they could safely approach him and take him into \ncustody. Despite the officers' best efforts to resolve the situation peacefully, Diaz \nremained uncooperative. Instead, Diaz showed he was unwilling to comply and instead \npicked up his gun and pointed it at the officers, thwarting every attempt the officers made \nto de-escalate the situation. \n \nANALYSIS \n \nWhen Diaz showed up at the golf course armed with two handguns, his presence and \nbehavior sparked fear in all who encountered him. Employees and golfers ran to seek \ncover and called 911 for help. Diaz was clearly in a state of mental distress and, armed \nwith two loaded handguns, he posed a danger to those present at the golf course. \nWitnesses described Diaz’s behavior as abnormal and told investigators they thought \nDiaz may have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Witness #1 told the 911 \noperator that Diaz was “having an episode,” and had shot a gun inside the residence. \nWitness #1’s son told the operator that Diaz was “having a manic episode” and believed \nsomeone was “in the walls of the house” and was trying to kill him. The toxicology results \n(200 ng/mL of amphetamine and 2200 ng/mL of methamphetamine) revealed that Diaz \nwas under the influence of methamphetamine. It is possible Diaz was suffering from \nmethamphetamine-induced psychosis.21 Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and \nOfficers Mutter, Jones, and Sein knew what the witnesses had reported. While the officers \ndid not know what was causing Diaz to behave this way, they correctly recognized that \nDiaz posed a danger to those around him. In the face of danger, Sergeant McLane, \nCorporal Campa, and Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein responded to protect those \npresent that day. \n \nSergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officer Mutter listened to Witness #1’s 911 call \nand heard first-hand her conversation with the dispatch operator. The distress in her voice \nmade clear the urgency of the situation. Over the course of her six minute, 39 second \nphone call, Witness #1 advised that Diaz had fired a gun inside the house, that Diaz was \nupset, was having “an episode,” and believed someone was going to kill him. Witness #1 \ntold dispatch that Diaz was an off-duty sheriff’s deputy and had left on foot armed with his \nduty weapon. During the 911 call, Witness #1’s son got on the call to advise that Diaz had \n \n21 Methamphetamine can induce a transient psychotic state that is characterized by hallucinations and persecutory \nideation.

Officers Jones \nand Sein did not have the benefit of hearing Witness #1’s 911 call, but they knew what \nWitness #1 and her son reported because the information was provided to all responding \nofficers through dispatch.  \n \nThe officers were aware that Diaz’s residence was located within the Sierra Lakes Golf \nCourse community. Each of the officers knew that Diaz was in a state of crisis and that \nhe was walking around the community armed with two handguns. Before the officers \narrived, each of them felt a pressing concern that Diaz could become an active shooter \nat the golf course. Based on their training and experience, the officers understood that \nthe golf course was a vulnerable target, where civilians, enjoying a summer afternoon of \ngolf, would be unprepared and unable to effectively defend themselves. As the officers \nheaded to the golf course, urgent 911 calls flooded in from witnesses reporting a man \nwith a gun at the golf course, amplifying the officers’ fears and underscoring the gravity \nof the situation.  \n \nSergeant McLane called the Sheriff’s air unit to respond to the scene to assist. Fontana \nPolice Department’s armored vehicle was also dispatched to the scene to assist. \nHowever, each officer understood the urgency of finding Diaz as quickly as possible. \nSergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, and Officers Mutter, Jones and Sein were the first \nofficers to arrive at the golf course. Unable to wait for assistance and determined to \nprevent any potential harm to innocent lives, the officers immediately set out on foot to \nlocate Diaz. With limited opportunity to develop a tactical plan, the officers relied on their \ncollective training and experience. Almost immediately, the officers spotted Diaz about 40 \nyards away. Diaz was at the rear of two golf carts parked beside the putting green which \nlay in front of the clubhouse. Diaz matched the description given by multiple witnesses.  \n \nWhen Sergeant McLane first spotted Diaz, Diaz was standing near the rear passenger \nside of the golf cart. Sergeant McLane noted a ring of sweat on Diaz’s light gray shirt, \ndark like someone’s shirt would look after an intense workout. This, combined with the \ninformation relayed by Witness #1 and her son during the 911 call, led Sergeant McLane \nto believe Diaz was experiencing “some type of manic physical response to reality.” Diaz \nlooked in Sergeant McLane’s direction and made eye contact but quickly looked away \nand went down to his knees. \n \nCorporal Campa first saw Diaz sitting down near the two golf carts. Corporal Campa saw \npeople standing at the clubhouse and asked them, “Where’s he at?” The people pointed \nat Diaz. Corporal Campa heard Diaz yell something and saw Diaz point westward, as if \nto direct the officers’ attention that direction. Corporal Campa believed Diaz was trying to \nlure the officers into an ambush to kill them because the witnesses were pointing at Diaz \nas the suspect, but Diaz was pointing the officers to the west, diverting their attention \naway from him. Before spotting Diaz, Corporal Campa had seen three to four golfers \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 41 \n \n \nrunning north on the driving range, away from the two golf carts where Diaz sat, which \nalso caused him concern.  \n \nLike Corporal Campa, Officer Mutter also saw golfers running north on the driving range. \nThis is what brought Officer Mutter’s attention to the two golf carts and to Diaz, who stood \nnext to one of the carts. Officer Mutter saw Diaz point southward toward a thick tree line \nand heard Diaz say there was someone with a gun in the bushes. Officer Mutter shared \nCorporal Campa’s concern that Diaz was trying to get the officers closer and to divert \ntheir attention away from himself so “he could try to kill” one of them. Like Sergeant \nMcLane, Officer Mutter also noted Diaz was drenched in sweat. Officer Mutter saw Diaz \nturn toward the officers, fall to his knees, and put his hands in the air when the officers \nbegan giving him commands. \n \nBecause Officers Jones and Sein had to run to catch up to Sergeant McLane, Corporal \nCampa and Officer Mutter, they did not see Diaz until their partners were already walking \nacross the putting green toward him. When Officers Jones and Sein first saw Diaz, Diaz \nwas on his knees by the golf cart, just outside the putting green. Like Corporal Campa, \nOfficers Jones and Sein saw several people at the clubhouse. Diaz faced the officers and \nheld his left hand up, waving at the officers as if to wave them off. Officer Jones also saw \nthe handle of a black handgun in Diaz’s waistband. Officer Sein saw three people near \nthe driving range who looked like they had run away from the location. With so many \ncivilians in the vicinity, the officers knew they needed to contain Diaz as quickly and safely \nas possible. \n \nWasting no time, the officers began walking toward Diaz, and immediately began giving \nhim commands. Sergeant McLane calmly told Diaz, “Show us your hands, bro. Show us \nyour hands. Show us your hands,” and “Put your hands up, bro.” Diaz looked in Sergeant \nMcLane’s direction and made eye contact with him. Sergeant McLane was hopeful they \nwould be able to establish a positive line of communication with Diaz. Each officer had \nthe same goal: to safely establish communication with Diaz so they could de-escalate the \nsituation to a point where they could detain him to investigate what had occurred or \nconduct a mental health evaluation to get Diaz assistance. To that end, the officers knew \nthey needed to reach Diaz and to safely disarm him. The officers did not simply charge \nforward, running straight toward Diaz, and instead made their approach tactically, walking \ntoward him with great caution, all the while telling Diaz what he needed to do. \n \nAs they approached Diaz, none of the officers saw a gun in Diaz’s hand. However, \nbecause Diaz was reportedly armed with two firearms, the officers had their guns drawn \nand held them at the low-ready. As the officers continued advancing toward Diaz, they \nrepeated their commands. Diaz held his left hand in the air as if to comply but kept his \nright hand concealed from the officers’ view. Though the officers could not see Diaz’s \nright hand, based on the movement of Diaz’s right arm, it looked like Diaz was reaching \naround as if searching for something on the ground beside him. Based on the information \nand the officers’ observations of Diaz, they each reasonably believed Diaz was reaching \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 42 \n \n \nfor a gun. Sergeant McLane told Diaz, “Don’t reach for nothing, bro. Don’t reach for \nnothing, man.” \n \nTo reach Diaz, the officers had to traverse the putting green, which offered no cover or \nconcealment between the officers and Diaz. The clubhouse was adjacent to the putting \ngreen. Multiple witnesses were inside the clubhouse, where they sheltered in place, \nwatching Diaz and the officers through the windows. Though inside the clubhouse, these \nwitnesses were in danger because of their proximity to Diaz, particularly if he began \nshooting.  \n \nAs the officers crossed the putting green, they fanned out to position themselves between \nthe clubhouse and Diaz. Armed and in the midst of a severe mental health crisis, Diaz \nposed a danger to everyone nearby, including those inside the clubhouse and those still \nout on the golf course. While the officers did not see a gun in Diaz’s hands, they had \nevery reason to believe he was armed or attempting to arm himself. To prevent Diaz from \nretrieving a weapon and potentially starting to shoot, the officers needed to contain him. \nThey could not walk away from Diaz when civilians in close proximity were at risk. As law \nenforcement officers with the duty to safeguard the public, Sergeant McLane, Corporal \nCampa, and Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein knew they had no alternative but to confront \nDiaz. \n \nCorporal Campa warned his partners to watch Diaz’s hands. Corporal Campa distinctly \nheard what he suspected was a gun falling to the ground and saw Diaz concealing the \nmovement of his right hand from the officers. Corporal Campa told Diaz, “Don’t do it, \ndude. Keep your hands up.” Officers Mutter and Sein also noted that Diaz’s right arm was \ndown, moving around behind his body as if to find something on the ground. Unable to \nsee what Diaz was reaching for, the officers all feared Diaz was reaching for a gun. This \nfear was reasonable based on everything the officers had learned and observed up to \nthat point. \n \nOfficer Mutter yelled at Diaz, “Stop reaching, stop reaching, don’t grab it!” At the same \ntime, Corporal Campa and Officer Sein repeatedly warned him, “Don’t do it!” Meanwhile, \nOfficer Jones, who had moved to the right of his partners, noticed that Diaz was reaching \nfor a black handgun lying on the ground beside him. Diaz continued to ignore the officers’ \ncommands. Diaz went down onto his side and then onto his back, reaching behind him \nfor the gun. Diaz then grabbed onto the gun, and began to sit back up, pointing it at the \nofficers. When Diaz went down onto his back, Officer Jones saw Diaz grab onto the \nhandle of the firearm. Sergeant McLane, Corporal Campa, Officer Mutter, and Officer \nSein all saw Diaz fall onto his side or back, but they didn’t see that Diaz had grabbed the \nfirearm until he sat back up, swung his right arm toward the officers, and pointed the gun \nat them. \n \nWhen Diaz pointed his loaded handgun at the officers, the danger he posed escalated to \nan immediate threat. This created an urgent, life-threatening risk not only to the officers, \nPUBLIC RELEASE MEMORANDUM \nFatal Officer-Involved Incident \nDA STAR # 2024-20205 \nJanuary 9, 2025 \nPage 43 \n \n \nbut to the civilians sheltering in place inside the clubhouse. When the officers saw Diaz \npoint the gun at them, they each believed Diaz was going to shoot them. Sergeant \nMcLane, Corporal Campa, and Officers Mutter, Jones, and Sein honestly and reasonably \nfeared for their lives and those of the civilians in the clubhouse behind them. Confronted \nwith this critical threat to their safety and the safety of the nearby civilians, the officers \nhad no choice but to fire their weapons at Diaz to stop the threat.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nBased on the facts presented in the reports and the applicable law, Sergeant McLane’s \nuse of deadly force was a proper exercise of his right of self-defense and defense of \nothers, and therefore, his actions were legally justified. \n \nBased on the facts presented in the reports and the applicable law, Corporal Campa’s \nuse of deadly force was a proper exercise of his right of self-defense and defense of \nothers, and therefore, his actions were legally justified. \n \nBased on the facts presented in the reports and the applicable law, Officer Mutter’s use \nof deadly force was a proper exercise of his right of self-defense and defense of others, \nand therefore, his actions were legally justified. \n \nBased on the facts presented in the reports and the applicable law, Officer Jones’ use of \ndeadly force was a proper exercise of his right of self-defense and defense of others, and \ntherefore, his actions were legally justified. \n \nBased on the facts presented in the reports and the applicable law, Officer Sein’s use of \ndeadly force was a proper exercise of his right of self-defense and defense of others, and \ntherefore, his actions were legally justified. \n \nSubmitted By:  \nSan Bernardino County District Attorney's Office  \n303 West Third Street",

The scope of \nthis review is narrow. It is not to advise concerning best practices for law enforcement in \nthe field, but rather to determine if any officer committed a crime beyond a reasonable \ndoubt. \nOur review determined the evidence does not show beyond a reasonable doubt the officers \nin question committed any crime. Specifically, there is insufficient evidence to prove \nbeyond a reasonable doubt the two officers who fatally shot Anthony Tovar did not have an \nactual and reasonable belief that Anthony Tovar posed a danger of great bodily injury or \ndeath to an officer or civilian when they fatally shot him. \nFACTS \nThe investigation conducted by the District Attorney’s Office included: \n• \nDistrict Attorney Investigator interviews of the involved officers and civilian witnesses \n• \nReview of audio and video recordings by law enforcement, including dispatch \nrecordings and 911 audio recordings  \n• \nReview of physical evidence \n• \nReview of all reports \nMONTEREY COUNTY \nOFFICE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY \nJEANNINE M. PACIONI \nOn August 8, 2023, at around 8:40pm, Anthony Tovar approached a residence and repeatedly \nknocked on the door. While husband was not present, his wife and two-year old child were \nhome by themselves. Wife did not open the door but became alarmed and contacted husband \nfor assistance.  Tovar left before husband returned home.  Husband arrived and discussed the \nevents with his wife. He observed Anthony Tovar (25) on his Ring Camera footage and \nrecognized him as a neighbor from across the street.  The Ring videos show Tovar knocking \non the door at 08:40pm, 08:41pm, and 08:49pm. Husband then went to Tovar’s address at \n407 Hyland Drive and contacted him. Tovar claimed that he had been looking for his dog.  \nHusband left and returned home.  \nHusband estimates that around ten minutes later, Tovar returned to husband and wife’s \nresidence. Husband opened the door and stepped outside to speak with Tovar. Tovar pushed \npassed him and rushed into the house towards wife who was holding her small child. Tovar \npulled out a knife. Tovar said that husband had the ability to release Tovar’s friends from \nincarceration. Husband begged Tovar to release his family and tried unsuccessfully to take \nthe knife from Tovar. Tovar held a large knife to wife’s throat as he forced her, with her child, \nto the rear bedroom and barricaded all of them inside.  Husband frantically called 911 dispatch \nasking for a law enforcement response at around 9:30pm. \nMCSO Sergeant Gonzalez, MCSO Deputy Pantoja, MCSO Deputy Ramirez, and MCSO \nDeputy Perez responded.  At 9:33pm, dispatch advised the responding units that the male \n(Tovar) was inside the residence with a knife and had forced wife and child into the back \nbedroom at knifepoint.  At 9:34pm, Sergeant Gonzalez arrived on scene and was flagged down \nby husband who told him that a man (Tovar) was inside his residence with a knife and had his \nwife and child.  Tovar had locked the door. \nSergeant Gonzalez, Deputy Ramirez, and Deputy Pantoja decided to immediately enter the \nresidence.  After entering the residence, they rushed to the locked bedroom door and verbally \nannounced “Sheriff’s Department.” Sergeant Gonzalez kicked the door multiple times and \nwas able to get it open between 12 and 18 inches.  Deputy Pantoja was to his left.  Deputies \nyelled repeatedly for Tovar to “Open the door!”  Tovar had placed a dresser in front of the \ndoor to act as a barricade.   \nSergeant Gonzalez looked in the room and saw wife and child crying on the floor of the \nbedroom.  He also saw wife embracing her child.  He saw Tovar facing them with a large \nknife in his right hand.  The knife was over twelve inches in length.  Tovar was about five feet \nfrom the wife and child while Sergeant Gonzalez was five feet away from Tovar.  Sergeant \nGonzalez pointed his handgun at Tovar and yelled several commands at Tovar to “drop the \nknife!” Tovar refused, waived his hand in a “go-away motion,” and turned his attention back \nto wife and child. Sergeant Gonzalez estimated the knife to be around 3 feet away from wife \nand child. Sergeant Gonzalez fired one shot at Tovar hitting him in the torso. Deputy Pantoja \nfired one shot and Sergeant Gonzalez fired two more shots. Tovar fell to the ground.  The \nknife was removed from his hand, he was handcuffed, first aid was administered, and medical \npersonnel were dispatched. Tovar was pronounced dead on scene. \n  \n \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nThe California District Attorneys Association charge filing standard directs prosecutors to \nassess whether the evidence would warrant conviction by a jury, which requires proof \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The sole purpose of this review is to determine whether any \nofficer was criminally responsible for the death of Anthony Tovar. \nOn August 19, 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 392 into law, which \nchanged the law governing the use of deadly force by police officers and went into effect \non January 1, 2020. \nUnder PC 835a(c)(1), “a peace officer is justified in using deadly force upon another person \nonly when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of circumstances, that such \nforce is necessary . . . to defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury \nto the officer or to another person.” It also allows for the use of deadly force, “[t[o \napprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted in death or serious \nbodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or serious \nbodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended. Where feasible, a peace officer \nshall, prior to the use of force, make reasonable efforts to identify themselves as a peace \nofficer and to warn that deadly force may be used, unless the officer has objectively \nreasonable grounds to believe the person is aware of those facts.” \n“A threat of death or serious bodily injury is ‘imminent’ when, based on the totality of the \ncircumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the \npresent ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious \nbodily injury to the peace officer or another person.” (Id. at subsection (e)(2).) \nThe statute states that totality of the circumstances “means all facts known to the peace \nofficer at the time, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use \nof deadly force.” (Id. at subsection (e)(3).) \nUnder the law, any person—including a police officer—can use deadly force in self-defense \nor in defense of others if the person reasonably believes the immediate use of deadly force is \nnecessary to defend against an imminent danger of great bodily injury or death. The danger \ndoes not need to exist as long as the person reasonably believes the danger exists. Further, a \nperson acting in self-defense or defense of others is not required to retreat. The person is \nentitled to stand his or her ground or even, if reasonable, to pursue an assailant until the \ndanger of death or bodily injury has passed. This is so even if safety could have been \nachieved by retreating. \nPolice officers can lawfully use deadly force even if from 20/20 hindsight other feasible \noptions may have existed. The situation must be viewed from the perspective of a reasonable \nofficer at the scene. Officers are forced to make split-second judgments—in circumstances \nthat are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is necessary in \na particular situation. \nWhen a person has a genuine belief using force in self-defense, or defense of others, is \nimmediately necessary, a person is not guilty of a homicide unless the belief in self-defense, \nor defense of others, was unreasonable at the time.  \n   \nCONCLUSION \nThere is no basis to conclude that Sergeant Gonzalez and Deputy Pantoja had anything but a \ngenuine belief that deadly force was immediately necessary. Because Tovar kidnapped the \nmother and her two-year-old child at knifepoint, imprisoned them in their rear bedroom \nbehind a barricaded closed door, displayed a deadly weapon, failed to follow the lawful \ncommands of deputies, and given the totality of these unpredictable and extremely dangerous \ncircumstances, the deputies could reasonably believe Tovar was an imminent threat to the \nlives of his captors.  Therefore, insufficient evidence exists to prove beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that Sergeant Gonzalez or Deputy Pantoja committed any crime.  \nThe role of the District Attorney is not to evaluate the efficacy of departmental tactics or \ntraining, nor of course to consider issues of civil liability. Those processes may have the \ngoal of identifying areas for improvement in future similar encounters; they may take \nadvantage of the benefit of hindsight and information not known to the involved peace \nofficers. The role of the District Attorney in deciding whether to charge officers with a crime \nrequires judging their conduct and actions from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the \nscene at the time of the incident with the information available in a rapidly evolving high-\nstress encounter. Consequently, having found there is insufficient evidence to prove any \ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt, no further action by this office is contemplated or \nwarranted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 Ryan J.

Ferreria. I arrived on scene at approximately 2310 hours. I was designated the \nLead Investigator by DAIC Ferreria. I was assisted by District Attorney Investigators (DAI) Smith, \nGomez, and Williams. It should be noted that DAIC Ferreria and DAI Williams left the scene to \nphotograph Monterey County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) personnel involved in the shooting and \nthey conducted a round count of the associated OIS weapons. DAI Smith and I were then directed \nto obtain a statement from the reporting party, Victim 1. It should be noted that Victim 1 was \nseated in an MCSO patrol vehicle prior to the interview. It should also be noted that I audio-\nrecorded the interview with Victim 1 with my department-issued digital recorder (Item KH 1). The \nfollowing is a summary of the interview with Victim 1.  \n \nSUMMARY OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTIM 1:  \nAfter exiting the patrol vehicle, DAI Smith and I identified ourselves to Victim 1 and he agreed to \nspeak with us. Victim 1 confirmed he lived at 404 Hyland Dr. with his wife, Victim 2, and their \ntwo-year-old daughter, Victim 3. Victim 1 provided verbal consent to search the home regarding \nour investigation. Victim 1 stated a male adult, later identified as Decedent Tovar, entered his \nhome, proceeded into the kitchen area of the home where he grabbed Victim 2 and Victim 3 and \ntook them into a rear bedroom of the residence utilized by Victim 3.  \n \nVictim 1 stated Tovar first approached the residence at approximately 2030 hours on 08/08/2023. \nVictim 1 was not present at the residence but was informed that Tovar was knocking \n“aggressively” on the front door and side door of the residence while Victim 2 was inside the \nresidence with Victim 3. Victim 2 did not open the doors. After arriving at the home, Victim 1 did \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI Rpt. 001 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. K.

After he reviewed the Ring camera’s video to see who had been knocking \nthe residence’s front door earlier on 08/08/2023, Victim 1 said, “It seemed like the neighbor.” \nVictim 1 stated he went across the street to attempt to discover why Tovar had been knocking on \nthe door. Victim 1 stated he observed Tovar come around the side of a pink residence (407 #A \nHyland Dr.) behind 407 Hyland Dr. According to Victim 1, Tovar stated he had been looking for \nhis dog at Victim 1’s residence earlier in the evening. Victim 1 and Tovar then parted ways.  \n \nVictim 1 stated Tovar returned to 404 Hyland Dr. and knocked on the front door about 10 minutes \nafter his first encounter with Tovar. Victim 1 opened the door and noted Tovar was “acting kind \nof weird because he wanted to step inside the house.” Victim 1 stated he told Tovar they could \nspeak outside the residence. However, Tovar went around Victim 1, entered the residence through \nthe open front door, and approached Victim 2 in the kitchen area of the residence. Victim 2 was \nholding Victim 3. After grabbing Victim 2 and Victim 3, Tovar brandished a knife. Victim 1 stated \nthat Tovar made several comments including, “you have to help me, because I have some friends \nin prison, and you have power to get them out.” Victim 1 stated he pleaded with Tovar to release \nVictim 2 and Victim 3 and to leave the residence. Victim 1 stated he began struggling with Tovar \nand unsuccessfully attempted to grab of the knife. Tovar then forced Victim 2 and Victim 3 into \nthe residence’s rear bedroom and locked the door leaving Victim 1 outside the bedroom. Victim 1 \nthen called law enforcement.  \n \nVictim 1 confirmed Tovar had the knife prior to entering the residence. Victim 1 stated Tovar \nmade additional comments about friends in prison and that Victim 1 had the power to release these \nindividuals from incarceration. Victim 1 stated he didn’t know Tovar but believed Tovar was \nassociated with the pink residence behind 407 Hyland Dr.  \n \nVictim 1 stated after he called law enforcement, he continued to plead with Tovar to release his \nfamily and to not hurt them. Victim 1 exited the residence and spoke with law enforcement when \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI Rpt. 001 \n \nBy: D.A.

Victim 1 confirmed he was inside the home when he heard gunshots. Victim \n1 stated he did not hear anything prior to the gunshots. Victim 1 stated Tovar spoke mostly to \nVictim 1 after entering the home in the kitchen area, mainly concerning the release of Tovar’s \nincarcerated friends. Victim 1 stated he observed Tovar grab Victim 2 around her shoulders and \nTovar had the knife behind Victim 2.  \n \nVictim 1 stated when Tovar first knocked on the residence’s front door, Victim 2 contacted Victim \n1 to inform him of the situation. Victim 1 arrived at the residence approximately 10 minutes later \nand accessed his Ring camera system. Victim 1 stated he attempted to speak with Tovar through \nhis Ring camera system but the battery was low and he was unable to communicate with Tovar.  \n \nDAI Smith and I had no additional questions for Victim 1 and ended the interview at approximately \n2335 hours.  \n \nNARRATIVE: \nAfter the interview with Victim 1 was concluded, DAI Smith and I remained at the scene of the \nOIS. MCSO Forensic Evidence Technician (FET) R. Okaneku arrived and began processing the \ncrime scene. DAI Smith accompanied FET Okaneku while FET Okaneku processed the crime \nscene. DAI Smith also took digital photographs of the scene. I remained on scene with DAI Smith \nand FET Okaneku (See reports from FET Okaneku and DAI Smith). I left the scene of the OIS at \napproximately 0430 hours on 08/09/2023.  \n \nOn 08/09/2023, I assisted DAI Smith with processing several evidence items recovered from the \nOIS scene (See DAI Smith’s report). Later on 08/09/2023, DAI Gomez and I contacted Victim 2 \nat 17105 El Rancho Way in Salinas. It should be noted that Victim 2 spoke Spanish only. DAI \nGomez, who is a certified Spanish speaker with Monterey County, conducted the interview (See \nDAI Gomez’s report).

Victim 2 provided the grey \nunderwear to DAI Gomez. I took two digital photographs (Item KH 3) of the grey underwear \nbefore DAI Gomez collected them as evidence (Item LG 01). Item LG 01 was later booked into \nevidence at the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office.  \n \nDAI Gomez and I were also informed Tovar’s grey sweatshirt/jacket had not been removed from \n404 Hyland Dr. DAI Gomez and I accompanied Victim 1 to 404 Hyland Dr. and I recovered the \ngrey sweatshirt/jacket (Item KH 2) which was located on top of the bed in the rear bedroom where \nthe OIS occurred. I also took three digital photographs of the grey sweatshirt/jacket before I \ncollected the item (Item KH  4). Item KH 2 was later booked into evidence at the Monterey County \nDistrict Attorney’s Office.

Inv. R. Smith \nPage 2 of 4 \nSYNOPSIS: \nOn 08/08/2023, an Officer-Involved Shooting (OIS) occurred at 404 Hyland Drive in Salinas.  \nMonterey County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) Deputies responded to a call of a man with a knife. \nAnthony Tovar had forcibly taken a mother and her two-year-old child at knife point into a \nbedroom and barricaded the door. MCSO Deputies breached the bedroom and observed Tovar \nwith a knife.  The deputies discharged their firearms striking Tovar.  Tovar did not survive.   \n \nNARRATIVE: \nOn 08/08/2023 at 2219 hours, I received a request to respond to an OIS that had occurred on the \n400 block of Hyland Drive in Salinas, CA.  I arrived at the scene at approximately 2236 hours.  I \ncontacted Chief District Attorney Investigator, Ryan McGuirk, and District Attorney Investigative \nCaptain, John Ferreria, who directed District Attorney Investigator (DAI), Hunsaker, and I to \ninterview the Reporting Party (RP), Jose De Jesus Valdivia.  During the interview, Valdivia gave \nus verbal consent to enter and search his residence located at 404 Hyland Drive. Please refer to \nDAI Hunsaker’s report for a summary of Valdivia’s interview.   \n \nOnce we obtained consent to enter Valdivia’s home, DAI Hunsaker and I were tasked with locating \nand documenting evidence within the residence.  We were notified that MCSO’s Forensic \nEvidence Technician (FET), Rebeka Okaneku, was enroute and we would be assisting in \nprocessing the scene.   \n \nOnce FET Okaneku arrived, I was tasked with taking digital photographs of the scene which \nincluded the residence at 404 Hyland Drive, the evidence located within the residence, and photos \nof the decedent. After the photographs were taken, we marked each evidence item with yellow \nnumbered placards.  I took additional photographs of the evidence items with the placards.   \n \nI stood by as FET Okaneku took multiple scans of the residence at 404 Hyland Drive.  Once the  \n \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT. 002 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. R.

The items were photographed, but the gloves were not taken as evidence.  The coroner \ndeputy arrived on scene to examine and prepare the decedent’s body for transport.  When the \ncoroner deputy moved the decedent’s body and searched his pants pockets, an iPhone, a Mercedes \ncar key, and a DeWalt box cutter were found in the pockets.  When the coroner deputy moved the \ndecedent’s legs a spent projectile (bullet) was found that had been under the decedent’s boots.  I \ntook photographs and collected the items that were found in the decedent’s pockets as well as the \nmushroomed projectile (bullet).  They were labeled as the following evidence items: \n \n• Item RS-006, Black iPhone w/ gray case \n• Item RS-007, Mercedes car key w/ gray fob attached. \n• Item RS-008, DeWalt box cutter (yellow/black) \n• Item RS-009, Spent Projectile (mushroomed) \n \nThe evidence items were labeled, packaged, and placed in an evidence locker at the Monterey \nCounty District Attorney’s Office for storage.  Two hundred and eleven photographs were taken \nof the scene.  I uploaded the photographs into Evidence.com and labeled the folder as evidence \nitem RS-010.  Three additional photographs were taken of evidence item RS-004 (Knife) once I \nwas at the office.  I photographed the knife alongside a scale to show the length of the knife and \nthe blade.  I uploaded those photographs to Evidence.com as item RS-011. \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT. 002 \n \nBy: D.A.

I \ncontacted Victim 1 at his parent’s home, which was located at 17105 El Rancho Way, Salinas CA \n93907. Victim 1 signed a consent form (Item LG05) to search his residence. I signed this document \nas a Witness, and I forwarded it to DAI Kris Hunsaker. Victim 1 also delivered to me four digital \nvideos (Item LG02) from his Ring camera that was installed at the front door of his residence. \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.004 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez # 40333 \nPage 2 of 11 \nThese videos showed Decedent Tovar and his dog outside the victim’s front door. I also delivered \nthis evidence to DAI Hunsaker. \n \nConversations with Tovar’s relatives: \nOn August 9, 2023, at approximately 1104 hours, DAI Rachel Maldonado and I visited Tovar’s \nhome and we spoke to a number of Tovar’s family members who were gathered there praying. \nAmong the large group were Tovar’s parents, his sister and her husband. I spoke to these persons \nin Spanish and I gathered additional information about Tovar’s mental history and whereabouts \nthe day before. One of the Tovar’s sisters (Noemí) spoke both English and Spanish. I recorded our \nconversation using a digital device and I transferred the audio file to Evidence.com (Item LG03). \nI also photographed the Tovar’s medication and a knife we found at the home, which resembled \nthe knife Tovar used to kidnap the victims. The following is a synopsis of my conversation with \nTovar’s relatives. For complete details, please refer to the audio file. The names of the family \nmembers I spoke to were Berta Murillo and Ernesto Tovar (Tovar’s parents), Noemí Tovar \n(Tovar’s sister) and Jorge (Noemí Tovar’s husband.)  \n \nMental Illness: \nTovar’s parents stated that Tovar had lived with them through his whole life and was unemployed \nat the time of the officer-involved shooting (OIS). Tovar attended North Monterey County High \nSchool for approximately two years but did not graduate. There was consensus among the relatives \nthat Tovar suffered from mental illness and was taking some medications but the length of his \nillness,  depending on who spoke, was either three, four or ten years. Tovar’s parents did not \nexactly know what Tovar’s diagnosis was, but Noemí indicated that he suffered from \nschizophrenia. Ernesto and Berta stated that Tovar was being treated at Natividad Hospital for \nmental illness and, sometime in the past, he had been housed at psychiatric facilities in Monterey \nand Santa Cruz counties.  The Santa Cruz County stay lasted approximately one week and occurred \nsometime in 2021. \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.004 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez # 40333 \nPage 3 of 11 \nBertha stated that Tovar’s illness began in adulthood and manifested with hallucinations. Bertha \ndescribed Tovar talking to invisible persons. Bertha also stated that Tovar “didn’t sleep” and spent \nall night walking around their home. The relatives stated that Tovar was often profane and verbally \nabusive towards his parents but he was never violent at home. The relatives also stated that Tovar \nhad been arrested multiple times for various reasons, including mental illness, bad temper, and for \nentering a neighbor’s home without permission. Tovar’s relatives did not know that neighbor’s \nname, but they indicated that the neighbor came to Tovar’s home and told his parents that he would \nshoot Tovar with a gun if he ever entered his home again. Bertha stated that on one occasion, Tovar \ncalled her from the Monterey County Jail and stated that he could see her and Ernesto inside the \njail with him. \n \nNoemí and Jorge stated that they knew Tovar better than anyone else because Tovar often visited \nthem at their home (1157 Ranchero Drive, Salinas CA  93905) and he spent a lot of time with \nthem. They also stated that Tovar ‘s ex-girlfriend, whose first name was Destiny, was one of their \nneighbors on Ranchero Drive. \n \nIllicit drugs use: \nNoemí, Bertha, Ernesto and Jorge stated that Tovar used illicit drugs, including cannabis and \nmethamphetamine, which he obtained from friends. They also stated that Tovar’s mental illness \nintensified with drug use. Noemí stated that Tovar began using drugs after he completed probation. \nNoemí also stated that Tovar told her that he was anxious about finishing probation, so he could \nstart using cannabis. \n \nTovar’s whereabouts preceding the OIS: \nJorge stated that one or two days before the OIS, around 0400 hours, Tovar went to Destiny’s \nhome and climbed on the roof without permission. Jorge learned about this incident from Noemí, \nwho was informed by Destiny’s father, who saw him on the roof but did not call law enforcement. \nDestiny’s father spoke to Jorge about that incident and he was upset. \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.004 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez # 40333 \nPage 4 of 11 \nOn the date of the OIS, Tovar visited Noemí at her home and she became afraid of him because \nhe was “acting up.” Noemí was unable to explain what she meant by “acting up,” but she \nmentioned that Tovar was moving and touching his face. Her description seemed to describe the \nbehavior of someone under the influence of a stimulant. Noemí also stated that Tovar was “out of \ncontrol” because he had broken up with Destiny. Tovar was still with Noemí when Jorge got home \nfrom work at approximately 1900 hours, although he was outside the home in his car, which he \nhad driven to Noemí’s home. \n \nJorge described that when he arrived home, Tovar was “OK” but lacked concentration, which he \nattributed to the roof climbing incident at Destiny’s home. Jorge told Tovar that he did not want \nhim at his home anymore because of the trespassing incident at Destiny’s home.  \n \nNoemí cried (presumably at the prospect of not having Tovar visit her home again) and Tovar \napologized for his behavior and stated that he would not bother Destiny anymore. Tovar left Noemí \nand Jorge’s home crying, in his vehicle, after Noemí also told him that she didn’t want him at her \nhome due to the ongoing drama with Destiny. She also told him that she feared he would do \nsomething to her or her children when Jorge wasn’t home. Noemí explained that she feared Tovar \nbecause he did not take his medication and he was abusive to her parents. \n \nTovar’s relatives did not know when Tovar had last slept or for how long before the OIS, but they \nbelieved that he had been awake for 24 or 48 hours since the roof climbing incident at Destiny’s \nhome.  \n \nBerta stated that sometime during the evening, prior to the OIS, she saw Tovar standing outside \nher home, talking to a man. The man told Tovar in Spanish, “I saw you in the cameras” and “what \nwere you doing there?” Tovar told the man, “I went to get the dog. The dog went over there and I \nwent to get him.” Tovar’s relatives described Tovar’s dog as a white Chihuahua. Ernesto also heard \nthe conversation between Tovar and the man, and he provided a statement that substantiated \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.004 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez # 40333 \nPage 5 of 11 \nBertha’s narrative. Sometime thereafter, Bertha noticed police vehicles near her home and she \nwent outside and called Tovar but he was nowhere to be seen. Ernesto stated that after speaking to \nthe man, Tovar entered his home through a rear door and went to the kitchen. Berta and Ernesto \ndidn’t know where Tovar went thereafter he was in the kitchen. \n \nTovar’s medications:  \nInside Tovar’s home, on a kitchen shelf, I observed multiple medication containers, three of which \nhad labels from the CVS pharmacy located at 110 Laurel Drive, Salinas, CA 93906. The labels \nindicated that the medications were prescribed to Tovar by doctors K. Routiher or M. Garuba.  \n \nThe label on the first container was dated June 10, 2023, and read “15 mg Mirtazapine  tablet” and  \n“Take 1 tablet by mouth every day at bedtime.” The prescription was for 30 tablets and the \ncontainer held 29 tables labeled  “0 8 A”  which I verified on the drugs.com website as the imprint \nfor Mirtazapine, an antidepressant. The following two images are photographs of this medication: \n \nThe label on the second container, dated October 21, 2021, indicated a prescription for 60 \nBuspirone Hydrochloride 15 mg pills. The label read, “1 tab by mouth twice daily.” The container \nheld 57 intact tables labeled  “5 5 5 TV 1003”  and four half- tablets of the same medicine. The \ndrugs.com website indicated that the imprint on the pills matched the container label. The image \nbelow is a photograph of this medication: \n \nThe label on the third container, dated July 20, 2022,  indicated a prescription for 30 Olanzapine  \n5 mg tablets. The label read, “take 1 tablet every day at bedtime.” The container held 26 intact \ntables labeled  “CL 40.” The drugs.com website indicated that the imprint on the pills matched the \ncontainer label.

We did not find a knife set or any other knives.

Inv. Leo Gómez # 40333 \nPage 7 of 11 \n \n \nConversation with Victim 2: \nOn August 9, 2023, at approximately 1423 hours, DAI Hunsaker and I spoke with Victim 2 at her \nfather-in-law’s home. Present during our conversation was her husband, Victim 1. I recorded our \nconversation using a digital device (Item LG04) and I transferred the audio file to Evidence.com. \n \nVictim 2 stated that she resided at her home with her daughter (Victim 3) and her husband. On the \ndate of the OIS she was at home with her daughter. Victim 1 arrived home from work  at \napproximately 1500 hours to eat, and he returned to work at approximately 1600 hours. \n \nAt approximately 2030 hours, someone knocked on her front door, which was closed but unlocked. \nVictim 2 believed that the person at the door was her husband, so she approached the door, looked \nthrough the door glass, and noticed that the person outside was not her husband, but a young man \n(Tovar) with a small dog. Tovar was wearing a hoodie, sweatpants and a gray or black item over \nhis face. Tovar made eye contact with Victim 2, hand signaled for her to open the door and \nremained there for five or ten minutes. Victim 2 panicked and did not open the door. \n \nVictim 2 took her daughter to her master bedroom, stayed there some time, called Victim 1 and \ntold him that a stranger was knocking at the front door. Victim 1 told Victim 2 that he was coming \nhome and would arrive in ten minutes. Tovar stopped knocking on the front door for approximately \nthree minutes and began knocking on the side door that was located on the home’s north side, \nbetween the kitchen and Victim 3’s room. This door led from the kitchen to the driveway. \n \nVictim 2 called Victim 1 a second time and he tried to talk to Tovar via their front door camera, \nbut the device was not working. Victim 1 also told Victim 2 that he was driving home and would \nbe there soon. When he arrived, Victim 1 told Victim 2 that, based on what he saw through the \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.004 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. Leo Gómez # 40333 \nPage 8 of 11 \nfront door camera, he believed Tovar was one of their neighbors. Victim 1 also told Victim 2 that \nhe was going to go talk to that neighbor (Tovar) to see what he needed or wanted. \nVictim 1 walked to Tovar’s home, which was located in an alley perpendicular to the victim’s  \nstreet.  After speaking to Tovar, Victim 1 returned home and told Victim 2 that Tovar had gone to \ntheir home looking for a dog. After talking to Tovar, Victim 1 returned to his residence, and \napproximately ten minutes later, Tovar returned to the porch of the victim’s residence, while \nVictim 1 was taking his work clothes off to get in the shower. \n \nVictim 1 went outside and talked to Tovar, leaving his front door ajar. Tovar ran inside the victims’ \nresidence, stood approximately 10 feet away from the front door and produced a knife, while \nVictim 1 stood at the door. When Tovar entered the home, Victim 2 was in the kitchen and her \ndaughter was sitting at the kitchen counter, close to the dining room. \n \nTovar told Victim 1 to close the front door and made incoherent statements, demanding that Victim \n1 help him get his family members and his daughter out of prison. Victim 1 told Tovar to go outside \nwith him and let his wife and daughter go. \n \nAt some point, Tovar moved closer to Victim 1  (farther away from the child), so Victim 2 took \nadvantage of this opportunity to run and pick up Victim 3 from the counter area. She held the child \nin her arms and brought her to the kitchen, behind the counter, near the stove, and away from \nTovar. Victim 2 grabbed her cellular telephone to call 911 but Tovar told her not to call the police. \n \nWhile Tovar was making his incoherent demands, Victim 2 attempted to escape with her daughter \nthrough the aforementioned kitchen side door. Victim 2 held the child with her left arm against her \nchest and handled the door knob with her right hand, but she was unable to open it. \n \nWhen Victim 2 was facing the side door and struggling to open it, Tovar approached her, stood \nbehind her, and prevented her escape by wrapping his left arm across her chest and putting his \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.004 \n \nBy: D.A.

Victim 2 felt the blade against her \nskin.  \nI asked Victim 2 if she could re-enact this frightening event and she demonstrated Tovar’s actions  \nby standing behind Victim 1, wrapping her left arm across his chest and placing her right hand \nagainst the right side of his neck. \n \nWhen Tovar held Victim 2 and her daughter hostage in the kitchen, Victim 1 had his cellphone in \nhis hands, and Tovar told him not to call the police. Tovar then turned Victim 2 and her daughter \naround 180 degrees, away from the side door and made them face the kitchen refrigerator. Tovar \nthen turned Victim 2 and her daughter ninety degrees to the left of the refrigerator and pushed \nthem with force, against their will away from the kitchen, towards the child’s bedroom, which was \nlocated to the east of the kitchen, down a short and narrow hallway.  \n \nTovar kidnapped the Victim2 and Victim 3, closed the child’s bedroom door behind him and also \nclosed the bedroom’s window curtain. Tovar ordered Victim 2 to sit at the foot of the bed, which \nshe did, as she held her daughter close to her chest with both arms. Tovar began pacing along a \ndresser that was located to the right of the bedroom door, along the bedroom’s west wall. \n \nTovar then handed Victim 2 his cellular telephone and told her to dial Victim 1’s number. Victim \n2 complied and handed the phone back to Tovar, who continued walking around the room. Victim \n2 did not know if Tovar was able to talk to Victim 1, but eventually Tovar placed his phone on a \ndresser and told Victim 2 that nothing was going to happen to her or her daughter. \n \nTovar pulled all the dresser drawers out, looking for a gun and he asked Victim 2 if there was a \ngun in her house. Victim 2 told him that there were no guns at her home. Sometime thereafter, \nVictim 2 and Tovar heard sirens, and Tovar told her in Spanish, “I told your husband not to call \nthe police, now all of us are going to get fucked.” \n \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.004 \n \nBy: D.A.

Tovar removed his belt from his pants, threw it somewhere and unbuttoned his pants.  \n \nTovar, holding his knife in one of his hands, used his other hand to pull down Victim 2’s leggings. \nTovar grabbed the leggings and pulled them down with force from the waist area two or three \ntimes. While describing this horrible ordeal, Victim 2 used her hands to re-enact her and Tovar’s \nactions. Victim 2 moved her left arm away from her daughter, continued holding her against her \nchest with her right arm, and swiftly grabbed the top of her leggings near the area where Tovar \nwas trying to pull them down and she prevented him from taking her clothes off. Victim 2 told \nTovar that she would ask Victim 1 not to let the police inside the room and she asked him to not \ndo anything to her. \n \nTovar continued pulling Victim 2’s clothing with such force that he ripped her underwear and \npulled Victim 2 and her daughter off the bed. Victim 2 remained on the bedroom floor, holding \nher daughter. \n \nWhile describing the frightening assault, Victim 2 instinctively pulled her leggings down and \nshowed DAI Hunsaker and I the hole in her underwear, which she was still wearing. At the \nconclusion of the interview, Victim 2 handed me her ripped underwear, which I delivered to DAI \nHunsaker for booking at the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office (Item LG01). \n \nVictim 2 believed that Tovar was going to sexually assault her. She feared for her life and \nexpected Tovar to stab her with the knife at any time because she had already felt the blade against \nher neck. Victim 2 told Tovar that she would ask Victim 1 not to let the police come inside the \nroom and she asked  him to not do anything to her. She also repeatedly yelled at Victim 1 not to \nlet the police enter the room, as Tovar had told her that he did not want law enforcement \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.004 \n \nBy: D.A.

Victim 2 specifically told Tovar, “I am telling him (Victim 1) not to let them in, so \ndon’t do anything to me, I’m pregnant.” \nThe deputies who rescued Victim 2 arrived at the barricaded bedroom door when Victim 2 was on \nthe floor, holding her daughter, with Tovar standing above them with his knife. Victim 2 heard the \nrescuing deputies give commands to Tovar before they entered the bedroom but she did not \nunderstand what they said because she did not speak English. \n  \n \nWhen the rescuing deputies forced the bedroom door open, Victim 2 was still on the floor holding \nher daughter. Tovar stood up between Victim 2 and the deputies and they continued giving \ncommands to Tovar. Victim 2 did not understand the commands, but she believed the deputies \nordered Tovar to drop his knife. Sometime thereafter, Victim 2 heard a gun shot and she observed \nblood and flesh coming out of one of Tovar’s forearms. Victim 2closed her eyes when she saw \nTovar’s blood hit one of the bedroom walls, and she covered her daughter’s eyes with her left \nhand, as she heard two additional shots. \n \nEVIDENCE: \n \nITEM NO.

The interview was \nconducted at the Monterey County District Attorney’s Office in Salinas. Also in attendance was \nSgt. Gonzalez’s legal counsel, Terry Leoni. It should be noted that I audio-recorded the interview \nwith Sgt. Gonzalez with my department-issued digital recorder (Item KH 5). The following is a \nsummary of my interview with Sgt.

Gonzalez to describe in detail the \nincident that occurred on 08/08/2023 at 404 Hyland Dr. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he was near the west \nend of Boronda Rd. near Hwy. 183 prior to the OIS. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he was informed by \ndispatch that a male subject had entered a residence with a knife. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he made \nsure the responding deputies were using their emergency lights and sirens enroute to Hyland Dr. \nSgt. Gonzalez advised dispatch he was near Hyland Dr. and stated he had not activated his \nemergency lights and sirens to respond. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he was going to stage in the area \nwhen he was advised the male subject had a knife and was with the reporting party’s (RP) wife \nand child. Sgt. Gonzales stated he thought this situation was “a hostage/rescue kind of ordeal.”  \n \nSgt. Gonzalez arrived at El Rancho Way and Hyland Dr. and was approached by the RP (Victim \n1). Sgt. Gonzalez advised dispatch of his contact with the RP and that the RP had informed Sgt. \nGonzalez the suspect was in a rear bedroom with a knife along with the RP’s wife and child. Sgt. \nGonzalez observed another deputy behind him and told the deputy, “Let’s go. We’re going to make \nentry into the house.” Sgt. Gonzalez entered the residence at 404 Hyland Dr. and was told by the \nRP the suspect was in the back room and gave permission for Sgt. Gonzalez to kick down the \ninterior bedroom door. Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the bedroom door once and observed the door had \nbeen barricaded by a “heavy object.” Sgt. Gonzalez stated when he noticed the barricade, “That \nkind of like triggered in me like a different feeling. Like, this is serious and there is a lot of truth \nto what this guy’s saying that there’s going to be, we’re going to open the door and we’re going to \nbe faced with some kind of scenario.”  \n \nSgt. Gonzalez kicked the bedroom door harder a second time near the door handle breaking the \ndoor panel. Sgt. Gonzalez was able to open the bedroom door approximately 1 – 1 ½ feet to look \ninside the bedroom. When Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the bedroom door, Deputy Cristian Pantoja was \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.005 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker \nPage 5 of 10 \non Sgt. Gonzalez’s left side while Deputy Josue Ramirez was behind Sgt. Gonzalez and Deputy \nPantoja. Sgt. Gonzalez looked into the bedroom and saw a lady and child, later identified as Victim \n2 and Victim 3 respectively, sitting on the floor of the bedroom in “the northeast corner.” Victim \n2 was crying and holding Victim 3. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he observed the suspect, later identified \nas Decedent Tovar, standing approximately five feet away from the female and child. Tovar was \nfacing toward Sgt. Gonzalez but was holding and pointing a knife at the female and child. It was \nthen requested to take a break in the interview. \n \nAfter the break, Sgt. Gonzalez continued with his statement. Sgt. Gonzalez described the bedroom \nas a small room. After kicking the bedroom door, Tovar was looking at Sgt. Gonzalez and Deputy \nPantoja. Sgt. Gonzalez saw the knife in Tovar’s hand which Sgt. Gonzalez described as a “kitchen \nknife, 9 inches, he was holding it by the handle, pointing it at the lady and the child.” Sgt. Gonzalez \ngave verbal commands to Tovar to drop the knife. Tovar looked at Sgt. Gonzalez before returning \nhis gaze towards the female and child. Sgt. Gonzalez then fired one round at Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez \nsaid he had previously drawn his pistol upon entering the home and his pistol was kept at “low \nready” until he encountered Tovar.   \n \nSgt. Gonzalez recognized the object blocking the bedroom door as a clothes dresser approximately \n3 – 4 feet tall and the dresser did not allow the door to be fully opened. Sgt. Gonzalez also observed \na closet behind Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez stated, “What was going through my head at that point was \nif he gets an opportunity, and he lunges at them with the knife, was that he was going to harm the \nchild or the lady, and if he came at us, I would get stabbed or my partner would get stabbed. And \nso as soon as he turned to look at the lady, that’s when I fired my first shot.” Sgt. Gonzalez said \nthe shot struck Tovar in the front torso. Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar returned to “an aggressive \nstance” and Tovar continued to hold the knife in his right hand. Sgt. Gonzalez ordered Tovar to \ndrop the knife and heard Deputy Pantoja also order Tovar to drop the knife.  \n \n \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.005 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker \nPage 6 of 10 \nSgt. Gonzalez described Tovar as 5’ 6” to 5’ 8” with short hair and thin build. After the first shot,  \nSgt. Gonzalez said Tovar again looked at Sgt. Gonzalez before returning his gaze toward the \nfemale in the room. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he then fired three additional rounds striking Tovar at \nleast twice. Sgt. Gonzalez noticed a spent shell casing in the air and deduced Deputy Pantoja fired \nhis pistol as well. After being struck, Tovar fell to the floor. Sgt. Gonzalez heard someone state \nthat Tovar still had the knife. Another deputy removed the knife from Tovar and Sgt. Gonzalez \nremoved the female and child from the room. Sgt. Gonzalez turned over the female and child to \nDeputy Perez and Sgt. Gonzalez returned to the bedroom where he observed the knife was on the \nfloor between Tovar and the female’s location prior to her removal from the room.  \n \nSgt. Gonzalez provided his handcuffs to Deputy Ramirez who handcuffed Tovar. First aid was \nthen administered to Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez cleared the remainder of the home and cleared medical \npersonnel to enter the residence to continue to administer first aid to Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez directed \nDeputy Perez to separate the female and the RP into separate vehicles. Sgt. Gonzalez assisted in \ndirecting the set up of the crime scene and making the appropriate notifications of the OIS to \ndispatch. Sgt. Gonzalez directed photographs be taken of the crime scene and the victims. Sgt. \nGonzalez then returned to MCSO. Sgt. Gonzalez said the RP indicated Tovar was a neighbor and \nSgt. Gonzalez could not state if he knew the suspect by sight from any previous encounters.  \n \nWhen I asked, Sgt. Gonzalez stated he did announce “Sheriff’s Office” after entering the residence. \nSgt. Gonzalez stated he did not attempt to force the door open further after kicking the door the \nsecond time as he and Deputy Pantoja were able to see Tovar through the established opening. Sgt. \nGonzalez confirmed Tovar held the knife in his right hand. Sgt. Gonzalez was not given a \ndescription of Tovar prior to encountering Tovar. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he ordered Tovar to drop \nthe knife 3 – 4 times.  \n \n \n \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.005 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker \nPage 7 of 10 \nSgt. Gonzalez did not believe he had any additional options available regarding his use of force \ngiven the circumstances of the call. Sgt. Gonzalez stated, “At that point with what we were \naddressing, we were presented with a deadly force situation where there was no time to react for a \nTaser because a Taser could be ineffective.” Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar appeared to be unaffected \nby the first gunshot. Sgt. Gonzalez said, “In my mind, there was no other option.” Sgt. Gonzalez \nexplained the use of a Taser had several drawbacks including agitating Tovar causing Tovar to \nlunge at Sgt. Gonzalez or the female or child.  \n \nDAI Torres asked Sgt. Gonzales what was going through his mind when he fired the second volley. \nSgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar was still “looking for a target because the knife was, like he’s ready to \ngo, he’s looking to see, he looked at me and then he looked at the lady and that’s kind of where, \nand the knife was so close to them where it would take one step, one half second, and he could \nhave injured like whether it’s fatally or not fatally, and that’s kind of where I thought that he was \ngoing to take action with the knife.” Sgt. Gonzalez clarified “take action” to mean stabbing the \nvictims. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he constantly addressed Tovar and did not give commands to the \nother deputies inside the residence.  \n \nSgt. Gonzalez also clarified that when Tovar looked at Sgt. Gonzalez, Tovar was “scanning for an \noption to attack” and that was the basis for Sgt. Gonzalez’s first shot. Sgt. Gonzalez estimated the \ndistance between himself and Tovar to be approximately five feet and Tovar was also \napproximately five feet away from the female and child who were on the floor. Sgt. Gonzalez \nstated Tovar was standing, holding the knife while “scanning and looked like he was thinking \nabout what he was going to do. So if he had lunged at the lady, in my head, I thought we would \nnot be able to shoot because she would be part of the backdrop. I didn’t want to give him that \nopportunity. Whereas if he had lunged at us, we would still have a clear shot.” Sgt. Gonzalez stated \nother than his commands to Tovar to drop the knife, he did not have time to attempt any other \nforms of de-escalation. Additionally, Sgt. Gonzalez stated he did not have time to discuss the use \nof less than lethal options prior to entering the residence.  \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.005 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker \nPage 8 of 10 \n \nSgt. Gonzalez estimated 1 – 2 minutes elapsed from the time he entered the residence until the \nshots were fired. Sgt. Gonzalez stated Tovar did not say anything during the encounter. Sgt. \nGonzalez stated had there been ample time to retrieve the less than lethal shotgun, it could have \nbeen feasible to use. Sgt. Gonzalez stated the call from dispatch, the information he obtained from \nthe RP, and the fact the bedroom door was barricaded, confirmed his belief Tovar was the intruder. \nSgt. Gonzalez said the female was seated on the floor and was “sheltering” the child by holding \nthe child with both arms.  While both were crying, neither victim made any comments during the \nincident.  \n \nI asked Sgt. Gonzalez what he believed Tovar’s intent was when he first observed Tovar standing \nin the room with the knife. Sgt. Gonzalez said, “To inflict like serious bodily harm on someone.” \nSgt. Gonzalez believed Tovar was intent on injuring somebody. Another break in the interview \nwas taken at this time.  \n \nAfter this break, I asked Sgt. Gonzalez several follow-up questions. I asked Sgt. Gonzalez to \ndescribe the female’s position on the floor while holding the child. Sgt. Gonzalez stated the female \nwas sitting on the floor with her feet near her buttocks providing shelter for the child. Sgt. Gonzalez \nestimated the child to be approximately 2 – 3 years old. Sgt. Gonzalez estimated the female to be \nin her mid-20s. The female had her arms wrapped around the child. Sgt. Gonzalez said the female \nand child were chest-to-chest facing each other. Sgt. Gonzalez stated the female appeared to be “in \nfear for her life” as she was crying. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he believed the female was in fear of her \nlife because she was crying and she was sheltering the child from Tovar by wrapping her arms \naround the child. Sgt. Gonzalez stated he thought Tovar was going to stab either the female or the \nchild with the knife because of the way Tovar was holding the knife and the way Tovar “target \nscanned” by looking at Sgt. Gonzalez and then returning his gaze toward the victims attempting \nto ascertain which target would be the easiest to stab. Sgt. Gonzalez estimated the knife was \napproximately three feet away from the female and her child.  \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.005 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. K. Hunsaker \nPage 9 of 10 \n \nBased on his training and experience, I asked Sgt. Gonzalez what possibilities existed with a \nsuspect holding a knife three feet away from a potential victim. Sgt. Gonzalez responded, “A \nperson could get stabbed. It takes less than a second.” Sgt. Gonzalez did not recall Tovar moving \nduring the encounter. DAI Torres asked if the distance between Tovar and the female and child \nchanged during the encounter and Sgt. Gonzalez stated, “No.” Sgt. Gonzalez stated after the first \nshot was fired, Tovar maintained the same position and the knife remained approximately three \nfeet away from the female and child. Sgt. Gonzalez could not remember if Tovar moved toward \nthe female and child after the first shot was fired.  \n \nSgt. Gonzalez had no additional information to provide but said, “It was just a very dramatic \nsituation at the time.” When I asked Sgt. Gonzalez if he had previously encountered Tovar, he said \nhe recognized Tovar’s name after reviewing the CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch) and he knew \nTovar lived in the area. Sgt. Gonzalez said he knew Tovar, but he did not recognize Tovar during \nthe encounter inside 404 Hyland Dr. Sgt. Gonzalez said Tovar had previously registered with him \nas part of Tovar’s 290 PC status.  \n \nI had no additional questions for Sgt. Gonzalez and ended the interview at approximately 1045 \nhours.  \n \nNARRATIVE: \nOn 08/15/2023, I received the MCSO Crime Scene Log (Item 01AS) from MCSO Property \nTechnician T.

Inv. T. Torres \nPage 2 of 4 \ncompelled to provide a statement. Deputy Pantoja also had the opportunity to consult with his \nattorney prior to this interview.   \n \nDeputy Pantoja was asked a series of questions regarding his assignment, equipment, training, and \nexperience.  The following is a summary of his responses:   \n \nDeputy Pantoja said he is employed with the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office and is a Deputy in \ntraining.  Deputy Pantoja has been in the field training program for approximately 2 ½ months.  \nHe has been employed with the Sheriff’s Office for 4 years and was a jail deputy prior to his \ncurrent assignment.  Deputy Pantoja has attended the basic police academy and does not hold any \nauxiliary assignments.  Deputy Pantoja has not attended any specialized training other than the \npolice academy.   \n \nOn the day of this interview, Deputy Pantoja was 29 years of age, and his current title is Deputy \nin training.  Deputy Pantoja is issued a Glock 17 Pistol that utilizes a 9 mm round.  Deputy Pantoja \nis also assigned a patrol rifle.  The rifle is a Colt rifle that fires a .223 round.  The pistol and rifle \nhave an added department-issued flashlight attached to them.  The pistol has been issued to Deputy \nPantoja for approximately 4 years.  The rifle has been issued to him for approximately 1 year.   \n \nDeputy Pantoja does not carry a backup weapon.  Deputy Pantoja performs functions checks before \nevery shift on both of his issued firearms.  Deputy Pantoja qualified with both firearms the week \nhe started the field training program.   \n \nOn the day of the incident, Deputy Pantoja was wearing a class A uniform which consists of a shirt \nwith Sheriff’s Office patches on both sleeves.  He was wearing green class A pants and a duty belt.  \nDeputy Pantoja also had a badge on his left chest and a name plate on the right chest.  Deputy \nPantoja carries two (2) pairs of handcuffs, radio, flashlight, collapsible baton, Glock 17 pistol, \ntaser, OC spray and two (2) pistol magazines on his duty belt.   \n \nOn the day of the incident Deputy Pantoja was in a marked Sheriff’s Office patrol car.  The vehicle \nis equipped with emergency lights and siren.  The vehicle is not equipped with a camera.  Deputy \nPantoja said the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office does not issue body worn cameras to deputies.     \n \nDeputy Pantoja went on to recall the events of the day of the incident.  Deputy Pantoja said he was \ndispatched to a call that was a 911 hang up.  He was told by dispatch that a caller had said there \nwas someone with a knife and then the call was disconnected.  Deputy Pantoja was finishing a \ntraffic stop at the time he was contacted by dispatch.  After getting in his vehicle, a location was \ngiven on Hyland Drive.  Deputy Pantoja activated his emergency lights and siren and responded \nto the area.   \n \nWhile driving to the location, additional information was being provided to Deputy Pantoja.  \nDeputy Pantoja said he was told that a suspect was locked in a room armed with a knife, with a \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.006 \n \nBy: D.A.

Deputy Pantoja followed Sgt. Gonzalez into \nthe residence.   \n \nDeputy Pantoja said due to the severity of the information he was provided, he unholstered his \nfirearm.  When he entered the residence, Deputy Pantoja saw a male adult in the living room of \nthe house.  He ordered the adult to exit which he did.  Sgt. Gonzalez went down a hallway inside \nof the residence to a closed door.  Sgt. Gonzalez attempted to open the door, but it was locked.   \n \nSgt. Gonzalez told Deputy Pantoja to take a “breach position.”  Deputy Pantoja believed this meant \nthey would kick the door open.  Sgt. Gonzalez kicked the door approximately two (2) times.  \nDeputy Pantoja said he began to feel fear because it was unknown what was inside of the room.  \nDeputy Pantoja said he knew someone had a knife and possible hostages inside of the room.  \nDeputy Pantoja said the door appeared to be barricaded and it opened only slightly after being \nkicked.   \n \nDeputy Pantoja said he looked inside of the room, and he could see a female adult who appeared \nto be holding a small child and was in distress.  The female was crying as was the child and they \nwere on the bedroom floor.  Deputy Pantoja said the female adult appeared to be in fear for her \nlife.  Deputy Pantoja said he was holding his firearm in a low ready position and was scanning the \nroom.  Deputy Pantoja said he saw a Hispanic male adult holding what appeared to be a kitchen \nknife in his hand.  Deputy Pantoja said he was afraid because he did not know the suspect’s abilities \nwith the knife.  Deputy Pantoja said he began to give the suspect commands such as “drop the \nknife.”   \n \nDeputy Pantoja said he felt afraid for his life as well as the life of the female and child.  The suspect \nwas in close proximity to the victims as well as the deputies.  Deputy Pantoja said that the suspect, \nlater identified as Anthony Tovar, was not listening to any of the commands the deputies were \ngiving him.  Deputy Pantoja yelled at Tovar and said, “look at me.”  Tovar looked at Deputy \nPantoja and waived his hand in a motion that Deputy Pantoja took as “go away.”  Tovar was in a \nbladed stance and holding the knife out in front of himself.  Tovar then began to turn away from \nDeputy Pantoja and Sgt. Gonzalez towards both victims.  Deputy Pantoja said he heard \napproximately three (3) rounds go off from Sgt. Gonzalez’s pistol.  Tovar flinched and had a \nphysical reaction to the shots.  Deputy Pantoja said he believed the shots had struck Tovar.   \n \nTovar then turned completely around with his back to the deputies.  He faced both the female and \nthe child with the knife still in his hand.  The blade of the knife was pointed at both victims.  Deputy \nPantoja said it was at this time he believed it was Tovar’s intention to kill both the woman and \nchild.  Tovar took a step in the victims’ direction with the blade of the knife pointed directly at \nthem.  Deputy Pantoja estimated Tovar was only a few feet away from the victims at this time.  \nDeputy Pantoja fired a single shot at Tovar.  Tovar stopped and showed a flinch or physical \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.006 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. T.

Deputies forced their way in the room and removed the knife from his hand.   \n \nDeputies rendered basic first aid to Tovar.  Fire and AMR were also requested over the radio.  \nTovar was still breathing and had a pulse during this time.  Fire and AMR arrived and took over \nfirst aid efforts.  At this time Deputy Pantoja was relived from the scene.  The interview ended \naround this time. \n \n \nRECOMMENDATIONS: \nForward to District Attorney Investigative Captain J.

He also had the opportunity to consult with his attorney prior \nto this interview.   \n \nDeputy Ramirez was asked a series of questions regarding his assignment, equipment, training, \nand experience.  The following is a summary of his responses: \n \nDeputy Ramirez is currently assigned to the patrol division of the Monterey County Sheriff’s \nOffice (MCSO), which was the capacity he was working at the time of the Officer Involved \nShooting (OIS). Deputy Ramirez was also a breacher on the MCSO SWAT team, a drone operator, \nand a Field Training Officer (FTO). Deputy Ramirez has been a sworn deputy with MCSO since \n2015 (approximately 8 years).  He did not work for any other departments prior to MCSO. Deputy \nRamirez’s badge/CAD number is R8475, and on the day of the OIS his call sign was 1Z3.  Deputy \nRamirez is 31 years old.   \n \nDeputy Ramirez has training in the police academy, CPR training, less lethal force options training \nand arrest and control techniques training. He has not yet attended CIT training for Crisis \nIntervention or Critical Incidents.    \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.007 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. Maldonado \nPage 3 of 8 \nOn the day of the OIS, Deputy Ramirez was carrying the following firearm: \n• Glock 17, 9mm – Primary Duty Weapon \nThis firearm is department-issued.  Deputy Ramirez has had this firearm for over 5 years.  \nThe only modifications were a mounted flashlight and grip additions.  He last qualified \nwith this weapon in March of 2023, which was also the last time he did a function check. \nThe magazine was loaded to capacity (17 rounds) plus one in the chamber.   \n \nDeputy Ramirez did not fire his weapon during this incident.   \n \nAt the time of his response to the scene, Deputy Ramirez was dressed in his patrol uniform which \nconsisted of a tan shirt, green BDU uniform pants, a tan outer carrier bearing a badge, name plate, \nMCSO patches on both sleeves and a patch on the back of the carrier which read “Sheriff.” Also \non the carrier were a flashlight, pepper spray, taser, baton, handcuffs, magazines, and an admin \npocket with pens and a notepad. Deputy Ramirez wore a duty belt with only his firearm which was \nin a drop-down holster attached to his leg.  He also wore tactical boots.   \n \nOn the day of the OIS, Deputy Ramirez’s assigned vehicle was patrol unit 3089.  Deputy Ramirez \nwas working in an FTO capacity the evening of the shooting, and he shared this vehicle with his \ntrainee, Deputy Pantoja, who conducted an inspection on the vehicle prior to the start of the shift.  \nDeputy Ramirez believed all the equipment in the vehicle was functioning. The vehicle was \nequipped with a less lethal shotgun.  Deputy Ramirez said the vehicle usually has a WRAP, which \nis a device used to restrain combative individuals. He did not know if the WRAP was in the trunk \nthat evening since he did not inspect the vehicle. The vehicle was not equipped with any cameras.   \n \nDeputy Ramirez was then asked to explain in his own words the circumstances surrounding this \nOIS.  The following is a summary of his statement: \n \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.007 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. Maldonado \nPage 4 of 8 \nDeputy Ramirez and Deputy Pantoja were on patrol and had just cleared a traffic stop in the city \nof Salinas at Boronda Road and North Main St.  Dispatch advised of a 911 hangup call where a \nreporting party (RP) reported a man was inside of his residence with a knife.  While enroute to the \nscene, dispatch updated something regarding a mother and a child; however, due to the chaos he, \ncould not recall any more details.   \n \nDeputy Pantoja was driving, and they headed towards the residence with lights and sirens \nactivated.  Deputy Ramirez was the passenger and was talking to Deputy Pantoja making sure they \nknew where they were going and the fastest route to take.   \n \nDeputy Ramirez heard Sergeant David Gonzalez advise he had arrived on scene just a few seconds \nbefore he and Deputy Pantoja arrived.  Deputy Ramirez saw Sergeant Gonzalez speaking with a \nmale outside in front of the house.  As they were exiting the vehicle, they saw Sergeant Gonzalez \nrun into the home.  Deputy Pantoja immediately ran after Sergeant Gonzalez.  Deputy Ramirez \nimmediately followed Deputy Pantoja.  As he entered the home, Deputy Ramirez could see \nSergeant Gonzalez at the right side of a door in a hallway just past the kitchen.  Deputy Pantoja \nmet and stood to the left of that same door.  Sergeant Gonzalez began to kick in the door as Deputy \nRamirez arrived and stood directly behind Deputy Pantoja.  He said the room was at the northeast \ncorner of the home.   \n \nAs the door was kicked open, they noticed it was obstructed by an object, and they could not enter.  \nDeputy Ramirez could not see inside, but he knew Deputy Pantoja and Sergeant Gonzalez were \nchallenging someone as they shouted, “Drop the knife.”  As this was going on, Deputy Ramirez \nwas able to see into the opposite side of the room where a mother and a child were on the floor. \nHe described them as being terrified, trembling, and hugging each other.   \n \nDeputy Ramirez said commands continued towards the suspect to drop the knife.  Deputy Ramirez \nsaid he also made commands to drop the knife even though he could not see the suspect.  Deputy \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.007 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. Maldonado \nPage 5 of 8 \nRamirez then heard a firearm discharge followed by more commands to drop the knife.  Deputy \nRamirez heard a firearm discharge again, and then they entered the room.  As they entered, Deputy \nRamirez could see the suspect on the floor.  He also saw the knife. \n \nDeputy Ramirez went directly to the mother and child, got them up and escorted them out of the \nroom.  Deputy Ramirez returned to the room, handcuffed the suspect, turned him over and began \nto render medical aid (refer to the audio recording for details on Deputy Ramirez’s efforts to treat \nthe suspect).  AMR and fire personnel arrived a short time later and took over medical treatment \nof the suspect.   \n \nDeputy Ramirez recalled that the officers present during the shooting were Sergeant Gonzalez, \nDeputy Pantoja, Deputy Perez and himself.  \n \nI followed up with questions for Deputy Ramirez regarding his mindset during this incident. After \nhearing initial radio traffic, Deputy Ramirez was in fear for the mother and child.  He said he has \ntwo daughters himself, so this was terrifying.   \n \nDeputy Ramirez said he had no prior knowledge of the suspect, and he did not know who the \nsuspect was.  Deputy Ramirez said he had no interactions with the suspect prior to the shooting, \nand the only time he saw him was after deputies entered the room.  Prior to the shooting, Deputy \nRamirez did not hear or see the suspect.  \n \nDeputy Ramirez did not recall if any description of the suspect was broadcasted prior to his arrival.  \nDeputy Ramirez’s mindset upon arrival was that he needed to be with his sergeant and Deputy \nPantoja.  He said he did not know if Sergeant Gonzalez heard or saw something, but since he ran \ninto the house by himself, Deputy Pantoja and Deputy Ramirez immediately followed him so they \ncould go in together.   \n \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.007 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. Maldonado \nPage 6 of 8 \nDeputy Ramirez said there was no plan formulated during this incident, and everything happened \nso quickly that he could only react to the other officers’ actions. Deputy Ramirez did not hear \ncommunication during the call amongst officers, but he was the last to walk up.  As he walked up, \nhe put his hand on the shoulder of Deputy Pantoja in preparation for room entry and to alert Deputy \nPantoja that Deputy Ramirez was behind him.  This was for tactical purposes as he was trained \nduring SWAT.  Deputy Ramirez said that had they been able to enter the room at that point, he \nwould have remained with Deputy Pantoja and provided him direction while dealing with the \nsituation.  Due to the circumstances, Deputy Ramirez was not able to do this.  \n \nUpon arrival at the scene, Deputy Ramirez recalled Sergeant Gonzalez talking to a male he \nbelieved to be the reporting party.  The male appeared to be in a state of panic. Deputy Ramirez \ndid not hear their exchange.   \n \nDeputy Ramirez did not recall anyone on scene verbally identify themselves as law enforcement.  \nHe said the command of “drop the knife” was given several times.  He said it was more than two. \nHe could not recall any background noise that would obstruct the suspect’s ability to hear \ncommands.   \n \nDeputy Ramirez described the layout of the residence as a living room that feeds into the kitchen.  \nThe kitchen leads to a hallway where the door to the room is located.  This was where the four \nofficers were positioned as they challenged the suspect.  From where he was standing in the \nhallway, Deputy Ramirez estimated he was 10 feet from the mother and child in the room.  \n \nDeputy Ramirez said he did not discharge his weapon.  Sergeant Gonzalez and Deputy Pantoja \ndischarged their weapons.  \n \nI asked Deputy Ramirez what he thought the suspect was trying to do.  He mentioned there were \nmany unknowns regarding the suspect and he was worried he would violently hurt the mother and \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.007 \n \nBy: D.A.

He was thinking the worst based on the fact he believed the suspect was a random \nperson in the home, and he was worried of a violent sexual assault.  \n \nDAI Bell asked Deputy Ramirez if any information he received gave him the sense of the type of \ncall this was, specifically to know whether this was a stranger or a domestic violence situation.  \nDeputy Ramirez responded that he could not discern what type of call it was, nor could he know \nif there were issues with the RP. In his mind, Deputy Ramirez understood this to be a hostage \nsituation based on the information he was given.  \n \nDeputy Ramirez said that there were no other force options available to deal with the situation.  He \nsaid that everything happened very quickly and the deputies that shot had to instantly react to what \nwas in front of them.  From the time they entered the home until the time of the shots, Deputy \nRamirez estimated it was less than a minute. In his mind, when he saw the door was intentionally \nblocked by the suspect, he believed the suspect was trying to prevent anyone from entering the \nroom.    \n \nDAI Bell asked Deputy Ramirez about the potential danger of a person with a knife, based on his \ntraining and experience.  He said a knife can cause severe damage or life-threatening injuries.  It \ncould take seconds for a person with a knife to severely injure someone.  In this situation, there \nwas not enough time to run to a vehicle to get a less lethal option.  When they arrived, the \nimmediate instinct was to be with Sergeant Gonzalez, so he was not by himself, and Deputy \nRamirez needed to remain with Deputy Pantoja.  \n \nDeputy Ramirez said that upon opening the door, it opened about a foot.  With the layout of the \nhallway and the amount of space available, they would not have been able to deploy a taser or \nother less lethal options.  Deputy Ramirez did not have a good angle or view to deploy one of these \noptions.   \n \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.007 \n \nBy: D.A.

Inv. J. Bell \nPage 4 of 6 \nDeputy Perez told me the following in summary: \n \nDeputy Perez is normally assigned to coastal patrol, but they were short staffed in Salinas \nand he volunteered to be reassigned. Deputy Perez was with Deputy Ramirez and Deputy Pantoja \nat a traffic stop at Boronda Rd. and North Main Street. At approximately 2132, hours he received \na dispatch call from Monterey County Communications that a male was reporting that a subject \nwas in his house with a knife locked in a room. He said the details were vague at that time. \n \nDeputy Perez responded to 404 Hyland Drive with lights and sirens (code 3) behind Deputy \nRamirez and Deputy Pantoja. He received updates that the reporting party (RP) was asking them \nto hurry, and said that the subject was in the house with his wife with a knife.  \n \nDeputy Perez heard Sgt. Gonzales attach himself to the call. They received an update that \nthere was a man with a knife locked in a room with the caller’s wife and child. Sgt. Gonzales \narrived and updated over the radio that he was being flagged down by a male.  \n \nDeputy Perez arrived on scene shortly after. Deputy Perez saw Deputy Pantoja and Deputy \nRamirez running towards the front of the house. Deputy Perez started running after them then \npaused for a second and thought that he should get the less lethal shotgun out of his trunk. Deputy \nPerez saw Sgt. Gonzales “basically leap into the house” and he felt that Sgt. Gonzales had more \ninformation because he had arrived first and had spoken to the RP already. Based on Sgt. Gonzales’ \nactions and the information he had already received, Deputy Perez felt that the circumstances were \nso exigent that there was not time to go back and get the less lethal shotgun. Deputy Perez ran \ntowards the house.  \n \nDeputy Perez said based on the information he had received from dispatch told him that \nthey needed to get into the house quickly. He felt that the subjects were in danger, and he felt that \nthere was just no time. Based on the information he had, he felt that the suspect’s intention was to \nharm the woman and child or the responding deputies.  \n \nWhen Deputy Perez got to the front door of the residence, he, the RP, and another male \nwere standing just outside the house and he told them to get farther away. When he was inside, he \ncould hear kicking “bang bang” and the voice of Sgt. Gonzales yelling “open the door, open the \ndoor” When Deputy Perez got to the hallway, he could see Sgt. Gonzales to the right and Deputy \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.008 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. J. Bell \nPage 5 of 6 \nPantoja a little bit to the left. Deputy Perez was right behind Deputy Ramirez. He could see that \nthe door was open 1.5 to 2 feet and appeared to be barricaded by a dresser with a mirror attached \nto it. He could see the deputies trying to push it but it would not move. At that time all he could \nsee through the opening in the door was the dresser blocking the doorway and the back wall of the \nroom. Deputy Perez could not see the mother and child or the suspect in the room. He then heard \n“drop the knife, drop the knife” before hearing a bang, and then another bang. He said there was \nabout 5 seconds between the first bang and the second bang. \n \nI asked if there was anything going on at the time of the commands to drop the knife that \nwould have prevented someone from hearing the deputies. He said there was not. I asked if he \nheard any announcements that it was the police or sheriff’s department, and he said, “no.”  \n \nWhen Deputy Perez saw that the door was barricaded, Deputy Perez thought that meant \nthat the victims were in danger. That meant that the suspect was not going to come out, and was \ngoing to harm the child or the mother, because he had barricaded himself in with them.  \n \nDeputy Perez turned around and saw the RP behind him and had to tell him to get back \noutside. \n \nDeputy Perez had to help get the door open because it was still barricaded. He saw the \nsuspect on the ground wounded and the mother and child huddled over in a fetal position crying \nwith the mother bear hugging the child. They ended up breaking the door basically in half and \nclimbed over the dresser to get inside the bedroom. Deputy Perez pulled the mother and child out \nof the room and checked them to make sure they were okay. A little later AMR Ambulance arrived. \nDeputy Perez put the mother and child into his patrol car, and put the husband into another patrol \ncar.  \n \nDeputy Perez was told to remain with Deputy Pantoja and they did not discuss anything \nabout the incident.  \n \nI asked, based on his training and experience, what threat someone with a knife posed. He \nsaid a knife could easily kill or seriously injure the victims. \n \nI asked if Deputy Perez had the less lethal shotgun upon his arrival into the house, if it \ncould have changed the way the situation was handled. Deputy Perez said he did not think so. \n \nMONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE  \nBUREAU OF INVESTIGATION \nCase #: MCDA \n23-0005 \nSupplement #: \nDAI RPT.008 \n \nBy: D.A. Inv. J. Bell \nPage 6 of 6 \nFirstly, the less lethal shotgun has a standoff distance. Based on the fact that it was such a small \nroom he would not have been able to deploy it safely. Additionally, if the less lethal shotgun was \nnot effective, the suspect could have been angered and then taken out his aggression on the victims \nwhile they were barricaded in the room. He said that door was so effectively barricaded that it took \nthe deputies substantial time and effort to get the door open even after the suspect was down. \n \nDeputy Perez also described that he could not see the suspect from his position in the \nhallway, and that he would have needed to get around and in front of the other deputies before he \nwould have an opportunity to use it, and in doing so he would have removed their ability to deploy \nlethal force and have lethal cover.  \n \nDeputy Perez said he did not hear any sound from inside the room prior to the shooting, \nand could not see the suspect. He did not hear any words from the suspect. He did not have any \nprior knowledge of the suspect or the residence they had entered.  \n \nDeputy Perez thought that maybe 1 or 2 minutes passed between his arrival on scene and \nthe shooting. He said the whole scene was so dynamic and fast, everything happened in a split-\nsecond decision.  \n \nDeputy Perez never fired his weapon. Deputy Perez said he did not render medical aid to \nthe suspect because he was responsible for the victim and her child. \n \nDeputy Perez said he did not think they had any other force options based on how quickly \nthe events transpired. They did not even get a chance to think about using OC or other options. He \nsaid OC also would not have been a good option because everyone would have been effected by \nit in such a confined space, and they would have lost control over the whole situation. \n \nHe felt that if they had tried a taser, people are aware of how to defeat the taser. He felt if \nthey had tried to tase the suspect and it failed, he would have been angered into action to harm the \nvictim and her child. Deputy Perez said the suspect had the advantage over them the entire time. \nBased on what Deputy Perez saw once in the room, he understood the suspect was a lunge away \nfrom the victims and it would have taken less than a second for him to harm them. \nRECOMMENDATIONS: \nAttach to OIS investigative report.  \n \n \n                 Ryan J.

Kennedy called me and asked me to respond to the Sheriff's Office in Salinas to \nassist in this investigation. I arrived at the\n-\nat approximately 2230 hours. \nI contacted Sheriff's Office Records Clerk \nand requested a copy of the \nincident CAD which she provided to me. \ne , con ucted an inquiry in Tracnet of_ \nHyland Drive in Salinas. I did not see any recent reports associated with that address. \nAt approximately 2304 hours, Det. Sgt. Kennedy re-contacted me by phone and asked \nme to respond to the scene. I drove to Hyland Drive from the Sheriff's Office and arrived \nat approximately 2337 hours. I observed the area was blocked off with crime scene tape \nwith an inner and outer perimeter established. I observed a crime scene log was being \nmaintained and several people from the Sheriff's Office and DA's Office were on scene. \nI observed the patrol cars from Sheriff's Office personnel who first arrived on scene were \nstill parked in the area. I was tasked with returning one of the patrol cars to the Sheriff's \nOffice in Salinas.

I\nCase Status:  Closed\nDR Type:  Arrest Report\nBUTLER, CHAD - 34264\nWatch Commanders Insight\nOFFICER BUTLER, CHAD  Serial No. 34264  \n  \nWATCH COMMANDER'S INSIGHT:  \nI, Lieutenant Nick Giordano, Serial No. 37933, Watch Commander, Foothill Patrol, have reviewed this Level I Non-Categorical Use \nof Force (NCUOF) as well as the related reports, BWV, and photographs.  \n  \nThis NCUOF occurred when officers responded to a radio call for a domestic violence restraining order violation. Officer Butler and \nhis partner responded to assist the primary unit and canvassed the area.  While they canvassed the area, they observed a possible \nsuspect vehicle. Officers exited their vehicle to further investigate when the suspect suddenly exited the vehicle. The suspect \nrefused to cooperate or follow commands, attempted to assault an officer and a use of force occurred.  \n  \nUSE OF FORCE:  \nThe UOF occurred on a sidewalk where officers attempted to detain the suspect for a restraining order violation. The suspect did \nnot comply and attempted to strike one of the officers. The use of force by Officer Butler; firm grip, physical force, punches, elbow \nstrike, and bodyweight to the suspect, was objectively reasonable, and at the lowest level to reduce injury to the officers and the \nsuspect.  \n  \nFirm Grips: I find that the application of this force was objectively reasonable and proportional given the suspect¿s continued \nefforts to resist commands and prevent arrest. Additionally, de-escalation efforts by the primary unit; ordering the suspect to stop \nresisting and comply were ineffective. I believe the continued use of this low-level force was appropriate given the type of physical \nresistance enacted by the suspect.   \n  \nI recommend these applications of force be classified as: IN POLICY / ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.  \n  \nBodyweight: I find this application of force was objectively reasonable and proportional to the suspects actions and continued \nresistance.   \n  \nI recommend this application of force be classified as: IN POLICY / ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.  \n  \nPhysical Force: I find this application of force was objectively reasonable and proportional given the suspects active resistance and \nfailure to comply with commands.  \n  \nI recommend this application of force be classified as: IN POLICY / ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.  \n  \nPunch: One punch was thrown by Butler; in response to the suspect attempt to get to his feet.  This punch was also in response to \nthe actions by the suspect and his attempt to strike officers with a set of keys.  Given the proximity of all involved and the need to \nprotect himself, I find the punch appropriate and proportional to the suspect¿s actions.   \n  \nSergeant Gonzalez discussed the use of the punches with Officer Butler, in reference to Use of Force Directive No. 2, Strikes and \nKicks.  The discussion addressed the avoidance of intentional punches to the head to prevent injury to the officers hand.  Officer \nButler was receptive to the discussion and I determined that no further action is required.  \n  \nI recommend that this application of force be classified as: IN POLICY / ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.  \n  \nElbow Strikes: Two elbow strikes were thrown by Butler; in response to the suspects continued resistance. These strikes were also \nin response to the actions by the suspect and his attempt to strike officers with a set of keys.  Given the proximity of all involved \nand the need to protect himself, I find the elbow strikes appropriate and proportional to the suspect¿s actions.   \n  \nI recommend that this application of force be classified as: IN POLICY / ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.  \n   \nTACTICS:  \nDuring a canvass of the area, Officer Butler and his partner located the suspects vehicle. As officer Butler and his partner exited \ntheir vehicle, the suspect suddenly exited the vehicle.  \n  \nOfficer Butler immediately broadcast their updated location and advised units that they were Code 6 on the suspect. Officer Green \nlater updated it to a backup request.  \nForm Number: UOFS R-19 NCAT All\nDate: 2/20/24\nUser Name: N3162\nPage 19 of 46\nFINDINGS (INTERNAL PROCESS REPORT)\nUOFS\nCase Number:  2038314\nDR No:      23-1609126\nCase Type:       NONCAT - I\nCase Status:  Closed\nDR Type:  Arrest Report\n   \nDuring the initial portion of the contact (prior to the UOF) Officer Butler was the designated cover of\nficer while Officer Green was the contact officer.  \n  \nOverall, the tactics Officer Butler used prior, during, and after the UOF were objectively reasonable, necessary, appropriate, and \ndid not substantially deviate from Department procedures.   \n  \nDuring the NCUOF, Officer Butler made momentary contact with the suspect's neck. In addition to the unintentional neck contact, \nthe suspect sustained \n. FID Lt. Jordan #30895 was contacted and stated that the case did not rise to the level of a \ncategorical UOF. Therefore, the case was to be investigated as a Level I NCUOF.  \n  \nPOLICY / OTHER ISSUES:  \n  \nOfficer Butler did not activate the Digital In-Car Video (DICV) prior to the contact with the suspect.   \n  \nOfficer Butler's BWV was activated during the UOF and captured the entirety of the incident.  \n  \nOfficer Butler utilized profanity during the UOF incident to gain compliance from the suspect.  \n  \nThe minor deviation from DICV was addressed with a Supervisor Action Item (SAI). Officer Butler was reminded about Special \nOrder No. 45 (October 2009), Digital In-Car Video Use and Deployment. The use of profanity by Officer Butler was not directed at \nthe suspect in a derogatory manner and only utilized when the suspect failed to comply with commands. Upon conclusion of the \nUOF, Officer Butler maintained his professionalism. I believe that Sergeant Gonzalez adequately addressed the profanity during \nher investigation and no further action is necessary.  \n  \nI recommend that the tactics utilized by Officer Butler be classified as ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL / INCIDENT DEBRIEF.  \n  \nSUPERVISOR OVERSIGHT:    \nSergeant I Erika Gonzalez, Serial No. 41925, responded to the scene of the UOF and assumed responsibility as the Investigating \nSupervisor.  Sergeant Gonzalez completed separate and independent interviews of all the involved parties.  She canvassed for \nevidence and completed a thorough at scene investigation.  At the conclusion of the incident, Sergeant Gonzalez conducted an \nIncident Debrief to reinforce the positive aspects of the incident and discuss areas of improvement. I determined that Sergeant \nGonzalez on-scene investigation was thorough and complete.  \nFindings by No Org, WATCH COMMANDER - GIORDANO, NICK - 37933\nDate Reviewed:\n7/10/2023\nDate Approved:\n7/10/2023\nReviewed History Date:\n7/10/2023\nTactic Finding Action:\nNone\nReviewed Work History:\nPolicy Change \nRecommendation:\nNo\nUse of Force Related \nComplaint Initiated:\nNo Force Used Information for this Employee\nAction(s) Taken:\nNo Data\nWork History Review Comments:\nFinding Review Comments:\nForm Number: UOFS R-19 NCAT All\nDate: 2/20/24\nUser Name: N3162\nPage 20 of 46\nFINDINGS (INTERNAL PROCESS REPORT)\nUOFS\nCase Number:  2038314\nDR No:      23-1609126\nCase Type:       NONCAT - I\nCase Status:  Closed\nDR Type:  Arrest Report\nFindings by No Org, WATCH COMMANDER - LJUBETIC, TIFFANY - 36608\nDate Reviewed:\n7/26/2023\nDate Approved:\n7/26/2023\nReviewed History Date:\n7/26/2023\nTactic Finding Action:\nAdministrative \nApproval\nReviewed Work History:\nYes\nPolicy Change \nRecommendation:\nNo\nUse of Force Related \nComplaint Initiated:\nYes\nSuspect\nUOF Used\nLocation\nClassification\nAction\nHernandez, Edwin\nFirm Grip\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nHernandez, Edwin\nBodyweight\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nHernandez, Edwin\nPunch\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nHernandez, Edwin\nPhysical Force\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nHernandez, Edwin\nElbow Strike\nIn Policy\nAdministrative Approval\nAction(s) Taken:\nIncident Debrief\nWork History Review Comments:\nFinding Review Comments:\nI, Lieutenant Ljubetic, Acting Foothill Patrol Commanding Officer, reviewed this investigation, \nincluding related reports, Body-Worn Video, and Watch Commander Insight, completed by \nLieutenant Giordano. A review of Officer Butler¿s work history report revealed no area of \nconcern.  \n  \nOfficers Butler and Green, responded as an additional unit to a radio call of, Domestic violence \nRestraining Order Violation.  \n  \nAs officers canvassed the area, they observed the suspect vehicle parked. Officers exited their \nvehicle to further investigate and observed the suspect exit his vehicle. The suspect was given \ncommands to which he ignored. Officers approached the suspect and a Use of Force occurred \nas the suspect turned to face officers while armed with a pair keys and attempted to assault \nOfficer Green.  \n  \nOfficer Butler utilized a combination of Firm Grips, Punch, Elbow Strikes, Physical Force, and \nBodyweight to stop the suspect¿s violent and aggressive behavior.   \n  \nThe suspect¿s actions posed an immediate threat to the safety of officers, which ultimately \nresulted in the use of punches and elbow strikes.  In review of BWV, Use of Force Directive \nNo. 2, Strikes and Kicks and Use of Force policy, I found it reasonable to use punches and \nelbow strikes in response to the suspect¿s violent actions.  \n  \nIn evaluating this NCUOF, I determined the force used by Officer Butler was objectively \nreasonable, necessary, proportional, and within Department Policy and State Law.

Officer Green and \nhis partner canvassed the area and observed a possible suspect vehicle. Officers exited their vehicle to further investigate when \nthe suspect exited the vehicle. The suspect refused to cooperate or follow commands, attempted to assault an officer and a use of \nforce occurred.  \n  \nUSE OF FORCE:  \nThe UOF occurred on a sidewalk where officers attempted to detain the suspect for a restraining order violation. The suspect did \nnot comply and attempted to strike one of the officers. The use of force by Officer Green; firm grip and bodyweight to the suspect, \nwas objectively reasonable, and at the lowest level to reduce injury to the officers and the suspect.  \n  \nFirm Grips: I find that the application of this force was objectively reasonable and proportional given the suspects continued efforts \nto resist commands and prevent arrest. Additionally, de-escalation efforts by the primary unit; ordering the suspect to stop resisting \nwere ineffective. I believe the continued use of this low-level force was appropriate given the type of physical resistance enacted by \nthe suspect.   \n  \nI recommend this application of force be classified as: IN POLICY / ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.  \n  \nBodyweight: I find this application of force was objectively reasonable and proportional to the suspects actions and continued \nresistance. Officer Green maintained control of the suspects legs to prevent him from standing up.   \n  \nI recommend this application of force be classified as: IN POLICY / ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.  \n  \nTACTICS:  \nDuring a canvass of the area, Officer Butler and his partner located the suspect¿s vehicle. As officer Butler and his partner exited \ntheir vehicle, the suspect suddenly exited the vehicle.  \n  \nOfficer Butler immediately broadcast their updated location and advised units that they were Code 6 on the suspect. Officer Green \nlater updated it to a backup request.  \n  \nOfficer Green attempted to de-escalate the situation through verbalization with the suspect prior to the UOF.  \n  \nDuring the initial portion of the contact (prior to the UOF) Officer Butler was the designated cover officer while Officer Green was \nthe contact officer.  \n  \nOverall, the tactics Officer Green used prior, during, and after the UOF were objectively reasonable, necessary, appropriate, and \ndid not substantially deviate from Department procedures.   \n  \nDuring the NCUOF, Officer Butler made momentary contact with the suspect's neck. In addition to the unintentional neck contact, \nthe suspect sustained \n. FID Lt. Jordan #30895 was contacted and stated that the case did not rise to the level of a \ncategorical UOF. Therefore, the case was to be investigated as a Level I NCUOF.  \n  \nPOLICY / OTHER ISSUES:  \n  \nOfficer Green did not activate the Digital In-Car Video (DICV) prior to the contact with the suspect.  \n   \nOfficer Green's BWV was activated during the UOF and captured the entirety of the incident.  \n  \nThe deviation from DICV was adequately addressed with a Supervisor Action Item (SAI).  Officer Green was reminded about \nSpecial Order No. 45, (October 2009), Digital In-Car Video Use and Deployment.    \n   \nForm Number: UOFS R-19 NCAT All\nDate: 2/20/24\nUser Name: N3162\nPage 24 of 46\nFINDINGS (INTERNAL PROCESS REPORT)\nUOFS\nCase Number:  2038314\nDR No:      23-1609126\nCase Type:       NONCAT - I\nCase Status:  Closed\nDR Type:  Arrest Report\nI recommend that the tactics utilized by Officer Green be classified as ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL / NO ACTION.  \n  \nSUPERVISOR OVERSIGHT:    \nSergeant I Erika Gonzalez, Serial No. 41925, responded to the scene of the UOF and assumed responsibility as the Investigating \nSupervisor.

Officer Torres and \nher partner conducted a restraining order violation investigation when officers broadcast a backup for the suspect. Officer Torres \nobserved officers involved in a UOF with the suspect and responded to assist. The suspect refused to cooperate or follow \ncommands and attempted to assault officers during the incident.  \n  \nUSE OF FORCE:  \nThe UOF occurred on a sidewalk where officers attempted to detain the suspect for a restraining order violation. The suspect did \nnot comply and attempted to strike one of the officers. Officer Torres force applications were not excessive and were proportionate \nto gain control of the suspect who continued to resist.  \n  \nFirm Grips: I find that the application of this force was objectively reasonable and proportional given the suspect¿s continued \nresistance and efforts to prevent arrest. Additionally, de-escalation efforts by the primary unit; ordering the suspect to stop resisting \nwere ineffective. I believe the continued use of this low-level force was appropriate given the type of physical resistance enacted by \nthe suspect.   \n  \nI recommend this application of force be classified as: IN POLICY / ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.  \n  \nBodyweight: I find this application of force was objectively reasonable and proportional to the suspect¿s actions and continued \nresistance.   \n  \nI recommend this application of force be classified as: IN POLICY / ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL.  \n  \nTACTICS:  \n  \nOfficer Torres responded to the backup and immediately attempted to de-escalate the situation through verbalization during the \nUOF.  \n  \nOverall, the tactics Officer Torres used prior, during, and after the UOF were objectively reasonable, necessary, appropriate, and \ndid not substantially deviate from Department procedures.   \n  \nDuring the NCUOF, Officer Butler made momentary contact with the suspect's neck. In addition to the unintentional neck contact, \nthe suspect sustained\n. FID Lt. Jordan #30895 was contacted and stated that the case did not rise to the level of a \ncategorical UOF. Therefore, the case was to be investigated as a Level I NCUOF.  \n  \n  \nPOLICY / OTHER ISSUES:  \n  \nOfficer Torres BWV was activated during the UOF and captured the entirety of the incident.  \n  \nI recommend that the tactics utilized by Officer Torres be classified as ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL / NO ACTION.  \n  \nSUPERVISOR OVERSIGHT:    \nSergeant I Erika Gonzalez, Serial No. 41925, responded to the scene of the UOF and assumed responsibility as the Investigating \nSupervisor.  Sergeant Gonzalez completed separate and independent interviews of all the involved parties.  She canvassed for \nevidence and completed a thorough at scene investigation.  At the conclusion of the incident, Sergeant Gonzalez conducted an \nIncident Debrief to reinforce the positive aspects of the incident and discuss areas of improvement.

    "text": "MEMORANDUM \nTo: \nPolice Officer Shawn Virani \nFrom: \nPolice Chief Don Aguilar \nDate: \nMarch 26, 2024 \nSubject: Notice of Discipline- Written Reprimand \nThis memo is presented to you pursuant to Skelly v. State Personnel \nBoard (1975) 15 Cal. 3d 194, and Section 8.8 of the City of Santa Paula's (\"City\") \nPersonnel Rules and Regulations (\"Personnel Rules\") as notice of my decision \nto discipline you in the form of a written reprimand in your position as a Police \nOfficer with the City's Police Department (\"Department\"). Your written reprimand \nshall be effective upon receipt of this notice. \nI. \nRULES AND POLICIES UPON WHICH DISCIPLINE IS BASED \nThis Notice of Discipline~Written Reprimand (\"Notice\") is based upon my \ndetermination that you have committed one or more of the following violations of \nthe City's Personnel Rules and/or Department Policy. Please note that your \ncommission of any one of the following violations, standing alone, would support \na decision to discipline you. My decision to discipline you need not be based \nupon a finding or conclusion that you committed multiple rule violations and/or \nthat you violated all of the rules/policies set forth below. \nA. \nCITY PERSONNEL RULES, SECTION 8.1, EMPLOYEE \nCONDUCT \nIt shall be the duty of employees to maintain high standards of \ncooperation, efficiency, and integrity in their work with the City of Santa Paula \n(\"City\") and in their life as it impacts their work as employees of the City. If an \nemployee's conduct falls below standard, he/she may be subject to disciplinary \naction ... \nSome general acts for which an employee may be disciplined include, but \nare not limited to: \nPage 1 of 5 \n\"Committed to Community Service\" \n4. \nNeglect of duty and/or failure to perform assigned work in an \nefficient or effective manner .... \n21. \nIncompetence. \nB. \nDEPARTMENT POLICY 319 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT \n319.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE \nPage 2 of 5 \nThis policy establishes standards of conduct that are \nconsistent with the values and mission of the Santa Paula Police \nDepartment and are expected of all department members. The \nstandards contained in this policy are not intended to be an \nexhaustive list of requirements and prohibitions but they do identify \nmany of the important matters concerning conduct. In addition to \nthe provisions of this policy, members are subject to all other \nprovisions contained in this manual, as well as any additional \nguidance on conduct that may be disseminated by this department \nor a member's supervisors. \n319.2 POLICY \nThe continued employment or appointment of every member \nof the Santa Paula Police Department shall be based on conduct \nthat reasonably conforms to the guidelines set forth herein. Failure \nto meet the guidelines set forth in this policy, whether on- or off-\nduty, may be cause for disciplinary action. \n319.5 CAUSES FOR DISCIPLINE \nThe following are illustrative of causes for disciplinary action. \nThis list is not intended to cover every possible type of misconduct \nand does not preclude the recommendation of disciplinary action \nfor violation of other rules, standards, ethics and specific action or \ninaction that is detrimental to efficient department service: \n319.5.3 EFFICIENCY \na) \nNeglect of duty. \nb) \nUnsatisfactory work performance including but not \nlimited to failure, incompetence, inefficiency, or delay \nin performing and/or carrying out proper orders, work \nassignments, or the instructions of supervisors \nwithout a reasonable and bona fide excuse. \n\"Committed to Community Setvice\" \n319.5.6 PERFORMANCE \ni) \nAny act on or off duty that brings discredit to this \ndepartment. \n319.5.9 CONDUCT \nm) \nAny other on or off duty conduct which any member \nknows or reasonably should know is unbecoming a \nmember of this department, is contrary to good order, \nefficiency or morale, or tends to reflect unfavorably \nupon this department or its members. \nII. \nFACTUAL BASIS FOR DISCIPLINE \nOn or about August 30, 2023, I received a letter from Chief Deputy District \nAttorney Kevin Drescher complaining about your alleged behavior and \nrequesting an investigation: Specifically, DA Drescher alleged that you made \nfalse statements to the District Attorney's Office that you had obtained copies of \na surveillance video, which was later purged, and that you falsely claimed that \nthe camera angle of the video would not have captured any relevant information \nregarding the investigation of an alleged kidnapping and rape of a minor. 1 The \nDepartment conducted an internal investigation into the matter via an \nindependent, third party investigator which forms the substantive basis for this \ndiscipline. \nDeputy District Attorney Emily Reber stated that on June 23, 2023, she \nmonitored the victim's interview and discovered the area of the kidnapping crime, \nwhich was at the front of Ventura High School. DOA Reber then coordinated with \nyou to retrieve the surveillance video from Ventura High School. Sometime after \nthe victim interview, you told DDA Reber (via a phone call) that the camera \nsystem was down at the school, but you were going to continue your efforts to \nretrieve the video from the school. On June 29, 2023, you informed ODA Reber \n(via a text message) that the school camera system was working, and that \nco.pies were being made for him to pick up the following Wednesday. On July 7, \n2023, DOA Reber followed up with you again, and you texted her, \"Morning, I'm \noff today, but I have video from the school saved and will be combing through it \non Monday. As far as the motel thing, only what we have of Martinez.\" ODA \nReber interpreted this text communication as you telling her that you possessed \na copy of the school video. \n1 This second allegation that you falsely stated that the angle of the camera would not have \nprovided any relevant information to the investigation was determined to be unfounded and does \nnot form the basis for any discipline against you, \nPage 3 of 5 \n\"Committed to Community Service\" \nODA Reber spoke to you on July 13, 2023 to set up a meeting to discuss \nthe kidnapping/rape case and the evidence that had been collected, but you said \nyou were busy with a recent homicide, so you set a July 21, 2023 meeting date. \nDOA Reber believed she told you to bring the video from the high school to the \nmeeting, along with other evidence. \nAt the July 21, 2023 meeting, you and ODA Reber discus·sed the overall \ncase and what needed to be done next. When DOA Reber asked about the high \nschool video, you said that you were going to the high school to get it after the \nmeeting as well as other surveillance video from Ralphs and McDonald's. When \nyou asked ODA Reber about the exact date and time of the kidnapping so you \ncould search the correct timeframe at the high school, ODA Reber was confused \nbecause she believed that you already had the video. \nShortly thereafter, you texted DOA Reber that the video retention period \nwas only 30 days, but you were checking with the school district's IT department \nto see if the video was still stored on their servers. You ultimately determined \nand told DOA Reber that the video was not retained by the school. DOA Reber \nthen told you to provide a supplemental report explaining why you did not \nretrieve the high school surveillance video which you did. \nIll. \nANALYSIS \nIn Skelly v. State Personnel Board, supra, 15 Cal. 3d at 218, the \nCalifornia Supreme Court held that in considering the level of penalty in public \nemployee disciplinary cases: \n\"the overriding consideration in these cases is the extent to which \nthe employee's conduct resulted in, or if repeated, is likely to result \nin harm to the public service. Other relevant factors include the \ncircumstances surrounding the misconduct and the likelihood of its \nrecurrence.\" \nIn this instance, you inexcusably failed to ensure that potentially important \nevidence to a very serious crime was preserved. While you claim that school \nofficials told you that the video was available for \"some time\" after the relevant \nday, you never followed up to determine what specific period of time the school's \nsystem retained video. Further, you never timely ensured that the video was \nsaved or retrieved within the 30-day window after the crime resulting in loss of \nthe video. Luckily, as you later and accurately determined, the angle of the \ncamera would not have provided any relevant information. However, your \nnegligence could have resulted in the loss of critical evidence related to a \nserious crime. I do not believe that that there is sufficient evidence to support \nthat you were intentionally dishonest in your communications with DOA Reber \nwith respect to the status of the video. However, I recommend and direct that \nPage 4 of 5 \n\"Committed to Community Service\" \nyou be more accurate and precise in your communications in the future to avoid \nany similar miscommunications or embarrassment to the Department. \nAny similar instances of misconduct in the future will lead to additional \ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination. \nIV. \nPOST-DISCPLINARY APPEAL PROCEEDINGS \nYou have the right to an appeal of this discipline under Government Code \nsection 3304(b), Department Policy, and/or Section 8.8 of the City Personnel \nRules. If you choose to appeal this discipline, you must send me a Notice of \nAppeal within ten (10) days of receipt of this notice. \nFurther, a copy of this Notice of Discipline~Written Reprimand, which may \nbe considered adverse to your interest, will be placed in your personnel file. \nGovernment Code section 3306 provides you thirty (30) days to provide a written \nresponse to this memorandum, which will be attached to this document in your \npersonnel file. \nV. \nWARNING AGAINST RETALIATION \nThis provision is to notify you that it is illegal and inappropriate to retaliate \nagainst any person who has participated in complaining or providing information \nregarding allegations of your misconduct. You may not retaliate against any \nindividual who has provided information to the City regarding your misconduct. \nVI. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nI have read and understand this Notice of Discipline~Written Reprimand \nand I acknowledge receipt of this document. I understand th . \ncop of this \ndocument will be placed in my general personnel file. \nRECEIVED: \n-;- zt::.,·~ Zo<?c/ \nDate \nOfficer Shawn Virani \nPER~ONAL SERVICE WITNESSED BY~·, \n, / \n?l_ltt,/iY \n_1~ \nD~ \n, \n~----\nVON A (~/11 { LAI(, \nPage 5 of 5 \n\"Committed to Community Service\"",

    "text": "Verbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 1 of 29 \n \n0:00:00.0 Bryan Lentz: Okay. All right. We are recording. This is investigator Bryan Lentz. The \ndate is 12/13/23. The time is 1420 hours. And we're in the... Is this City Hall?  \n \n0:00:17.4 Shawn Virani: City Hall conference room. \n \n0:00:18.4 BL: City Hall Conference room of Santa Paula. And I'm speaking with, go ahead and \nstate your name. \n \n0:00:22.8 SV: Shawn Virani. \n \n0:00:23.3 BL: Okay. And is Shawn, is S-H-A-W-N?  \n \n0:00:26.1 SV: Yes, it is. \n \n0:00:26.3 BL: Okay. And do you have a ID number?  \n \n0:00:28.8 SV: 1134. \n \n0:00:29.6 BL: 1134. Okay. Great. And in the room with me also is?  \n \n0:00:34.7 Andrew Pongracz: Andrew Pongracz, private counsel and hearing representative for \nOfficer Virani. \n \n0:00:39.9 BL: Okay, great. This is being recorded by one digital handheld here on the table. Okay. \nSo, here's the summary of why we're here today. So during the course of a kidnapping \n \ninvestigation involving \n and a juvenile, it was reported... that was reported on June \n19th. It was alleged that you had communications with assigned Deputy District Attorney, Emily \nReber. And you told her two falsehoods, that you obtained a surveillance video from the high \nschool. And the second one is, is that the camera that covered that area was of no evidentiary value, \neither because it was poor quality, or it didn't cover the actual area of the crime. \n \n0:01:19.8 BL: So, there the allegation is you made some false statements to Emily Reber. Okay. \nNow, for Lybarger, you have the absolute right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be \nused as evidence against you in a court of law. Although you have the right to not incriminate \nyourself during this administrative investigation, your silence may be deemed insubordination and \nresult in administrative action being taken up to and including termination. Any statement you make \nunder the compulsion of the threat of such discipline is for administrative purposes only and cannot \nbe used against you in a later criminal proceeding arising out of this case. So if you could just print \nand sign and then I'll do the witnessing. \n \n0:02:15.1 BL: Great. Okay. Okay. So deputy, and do you want... If something else arises, do you \nhave a contact phone number just to schedule another... \n \n0:02:37.1 SV: Yeah. My personal will be \n \n \n0:02:42.2 BL: \n \n \n0:02:42.2 SV: Yes, sir. \n \n0:02:44.0 BL: And that's the personal?  \nREDACTED\nREDACTED\nREDACTED\nREDACTED\n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 2 of 29 \n \n0:02:45.0 SV: Yes, it is. \n \n0:02:45.5 BL: Okay. And obviously if something else comes up, I'll obviously go with you as well, \nand everyone gets on onboarded. Okay. So Deputy DA, Reber stated that she was in contact with \nyou in regards to the surveillance footage in connection with that whole crime. \n \n0:03:02.5 SV: Yes. \n \n0:03:03.7 BL: I guess the crime occurred in front of the school. \n \n0:03:05.7 SV: Yeah. It started there, yes. \n \n0:03:07.9 BL: Started there, yes. Yeah. Do you remember as in relation to the time when the crime \noccurred, when your communications with Reber started?  \n \n0:03:19.6 SV: It started early July, approximately. \n \n0:03:26.3 AP: About the video or at all?  \n \n0:03:27.9 BL: Oh, about the video, about obtaining the video from the school. \n \n0:03:33.1 SV: Mid-July, approximately mid-July. End of July. \n \n0:03:36.8 BL: Okay. Was that by telephone or text or email or?  \n \n0:03:41.5 SV: Text and... Text, mainly. \n \n0:03:43.0 BL: Text. \n \n0:03:43.1 SV: Yes. \n \n0:03:43.6 BL: Was that text on a work phone or your personal?  \n \n0:03:46.3 SV: Work phone, yes, sir. \n \n0:03:47.8 BL: Work phone. Okay. Do you have that work phone?  \n \n0:03:49.2 SV: I do. \n \n0:03:49.3 BL: Okay. So could I get the screenshots from your work phone and the... No, put it this \nway. On your communications with Reber, is all of your communications with Reber of a work \nrelated matter?  \n \n0:04:07.5 SV: Yes. And some personal just kind of jittering back and forth about work and being \ntired, overworked, and everything like that, just trying to make everything work, but yes, mainly \neverything is about this case. \n \n0:04:20.2 BL: Okay. I just wanna make sure that the communication, she was not a... You didn't \nknow her on more of a personal level and some of her... \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 3 of 29 \n0:04:30.4 SV: No. \n \n0:04:30.4 BL: Okay. All right good enough. \n \n0:04:31.0 SV: No, sir. \n \n0:04:31.2 BL: So could I get a copy of screenshots of those texts?  \n \n0:04:36.7 SV: Sure. \n \n0:04:38.6 BL: With her, and when you do the screenshot and you scroll up, try to make sure that \nthe bottom line of the first... The one page is the top of the second, so we can kind of... \n \n0:04:45.9 SV: Keep them sequential. \n \n0:04:47.1 BL: Yeah. Exactly. So if that can be from, I guess, it would be, well, June 19th is when it \nstarted, but you're thinking it was mid-July?  \n \n0:05:00.5 SV: I believe so. Approximately. \n \n0:05:04.5 BL: Okay. \n \n0:05:04.5 AP: There's a text thread with her?  \n \n0:05:06.3 BL: Yes. Oh... \n \n0:05:08.5 AP: It's a one single... It's an iPhone. I don't know if you're familiar. So it's all one thing. \nHe'll give you the entire... The interaction with her soup to nuts. \n \n0:05:14.3 SV: From start to finish. \n \n0:05:15.8 AP: Start to finish. \n \n0:05:16.2 BL: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So from June 19th through July. And then July, I have, there was \na meeting with you on July 21st?  \n \n0:05:26.6 SV: Yes, I believe so. \n \n0:05:27.4 BL: Okay. So during that timeframe. So June 19, which there might not be because she \nmight not have got wind of the... It might be more the couple late days later, but... \n \n0:05:38.4 SV: Sure. \n \n0:05:39.0 BL: Okay. Great. Okay. And my email is on the card. \n \n0:05:44.5 SV: Okay. \n \n0:05:44.5 BL: So you can... Yes. \n \n0:05:45.6 AP: I just wanna be perfectly clear. His first contact communication with the DA was \nsometime in late June. The video only came up in, I believe, it's July 7th, but you'll get the text to \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 4 of 29 \nconfirm. But the communication about the crime, the entire incident started a couple days after the \ncrime, like when the investigation began. \n \n0:06:09.0 BL: Right. Yeah. So I guess the... If there was... Yeah, so the whole communications, \nbecause I guess there on June, according to your report, June 29th or along those lines, you might... \nYou did a follow up at the school and so there might have been towards the end of June sometime, \nthere could have been some communications with Reber. \n \n0:06:35.0 SV: Yeah, but I have to re-check, but yeah, I can let whatever... \n \n0:06:39.2 BL: Okay. So just that, just so I... 'Cause I have some texts from one side, but I want to \nmake sure that they correspond and nothing is missed. \n \n0:06:50.2 SV: Okay. \n \n0:06:51.1 BL: Yeah. You know. \n \n0:06:53.4 SV: Yes, sir. \n \n0:06:53.4 BL: Okay. So your report, this is the supplemental number 26. \n \n0:06:56.5 SV: Okay. \n \n0:06:56.5 BL: Which it's kind of refreshing on a big case. I've never seen sequential supplements \nlike that. Is that a common thing here or?  \n \n0:07:05.9 AP: Yeah, whatever we kind of do follow up or we add something to the case or we \nmake contact, whatever has to do with the case, we annotate it and document it, for our purposes, \ninvestigative purposes and just keep track of our case. \n \n0:07:20.1 BL: Okay. Yeah. Well, like you... 'Cause I saw that on the whole case file there was one \nthrough 20 whatever. \n \n0:07:26.1 SV: Right. \n \n0:07:26.4 BL: And other detectives had their supplements in there too. \n \n0:07:30.8 SV: Right. \n \n0:07:31.5 BL: And it's just kind of neat to pick out, this is what I need instead of combing through \nbunch of stuff. \n \n0:07:36.9 AP: Through the whole page. \n \n0:07:38.7 BL: Yeah. It's kind of refreshing actually. So anyway, it was on June 27th that you \nwent... Oh, it was June 27th that you went to the high school with Detective Ramirez?  \n \n0:07:49.0 SV: Yes. \n \n0:07:51.7 BL: Okay. Was that the first attempt to get the video?  \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 5 of 29 \n0:07:53.7 SV: Yes, it was. In person, yes, it was. \n \n0:07:57.0 BL: Okay. \n \n0:08:00.0 AP: Go ahead. You got it. \n \n0:08:01.2 SV: In person, yes, it was the first attempt to get the video. \n \n0:08:02.4 BL: Okay. In person. \n \n0:08:02.8 SV: When we physically went there. \n \n0:08:04.0 BL: Okay. And did you call beforehand?  \n \n0:08:07.5 SV: I had called beforehand. \n \n0:08:08.7 BL: And who'd you talk to?  \n \n0:08:10.0 SV: I talked to Marissa Cervantes or Rodriguez, who's the principal of Ventura High \nSchool. \n \n0:08:14.9 BL: Okay. So it's the... Oh, the Principal Rodriguez?  \n \n0:08:19.7 SV: Yes. \n \n0:08:20.0 BL: Okay. Okay. And what did you talk to her about or how did... \n \n0:08:23.1 SV: I briefly explained to her that we have an investigation that led back to the high \nschool and that I needed to come and take a look at her surveillance cameras. \n \n0:08:30.9 BL: Okay. Okay. Was that all that same day on the 27th?  \n \n0:08:36.2 SV: I really don't remember, but, I believe... \n \n0:08:40.4 BL: Okay. All right. You don't remember like, different days?  \n \n0:08:43.4 SV: I don't remember what dates specifically. \n \n0:08:45.4 BL: Oh, okay. \n \n0:08:45.6 SV: But I had told her that I needed to come down and take a look at the footage. \n \n0:08:49.0 BL: Okay. And that was Rodriguez?  \n \n0:08:54.1 SV: Yes. \n \n0:08:54.1 BL: Okay. And when you went down there, who'd you all talk to or what happened?  \n \n0:08:58.3 SV: When I arrived with my partner, Hector Ramirez, we parked out front of the school \nand I called the Principal and she walked us into her office. \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 6 of 29 \n0:09:08.6 BL: Okay. And then what happened?  \n \n0:09:10.2 SV: At that point I asked her if she could come through the video footage and bring up \nthe camera angle that would best face the front of the school. And she attempted to bring it up and \nthe footage was black there. She wasn't able to get a signal, if I remember correctly. \n \n0:09:25.1 BL: Okay. Okay. So the whole system was down?  \n \n0:09:26.8 SV: The whole system was down. \n \n0:09:27.8 BL: Okay. So you couldn't even pull up prior videos or anything?  \n \n0:09:31.0 SV: No. \n \n0:09:31.0 BL: Okay. Okay. And then what happened?  \n \n0:09:35.6 SV: At that point we sat and talked for a few minutes. She tried to make some phone \ncalls to see if she can get it up and running. And she wasn't able to at that time. During this whole \ntime I had my body cam on as well while making contact with her, just so it's documented. \n \n0:09:50.4 BL: Oh, okay. So were you in uniform or?  \n \n0:09:52.6 SV: I was wearing what I'm wearing now, minus my jacket. So just my detective \nuniform, my polo, my PDUs. \n \n0:09:58.0 BL: Oh, but you had a camera on. \n \n0:10:00.4 SV: I wore a camera on my belt. \n \n0:10:00.9 BL: Oh. \n \n0:10:01.3 SV: Yeah. \n \n0:10:01.5 BL: Okay. All right. And that was on the 27th?  \n \n0:10:12.1 SV: I believe so, yes. \n \n0:10:13.9 BL: Okay. And is all of those videos downloaded to the system?  \n \n0:10:17.4 SV: Yes. \n \n0:10:18.3 BL: Just like any other patrol videos and stuff?  \n \n0:10:20.6 SV: Yes. \n \n0:10:20.7 BL: Is it the Axion?  \n \n0:10:21.2 SV: Axon camera system. \n \n0:10:23.9 BL: Axon. \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 7 of 29 \n0:10:24.5 SV: Yes, sir. \n \n0:10:25.3 BL: Okay. And did you... So you weren't able to view any camera angles whatsoever?  \n \n0:10:30.9 SV: No. \n \n0:10:31.2 BL: Okay. Did you look at where the cameras were located at the school while you were \nthere?  \n \n0:10:36.3 SV: As we approached the school, we were kind of looking around for cameras. I \nremember myself and Hector looked off to the left and we saw a camera further down on one \nbuilding. We were standing out front for a few minutes waiting for the Principal to come get us, and \nwe were kind of looking around and seeing where the best camera angles were. We only saw one \ncamera, which was further I guess you can say north of where we were standing. \n \n0:10:56.1 BL: Okay. Is that along Main Street or what's that other street?  \n \n0:11:02.8 SV: It's gonna be that side street that runs North-south. Right, right. \n \n0:11:05.9 BL: Catalina?  \n \n0:11:06.4 SV: I believe so, sir. \n \n0:11:07.5 BL: Oh, okay. \n \n0:11:08.0 SV: I believe so, 'cause you have Main, which runs east-west, and then you have the \nNorth-south, and we parked in the parking stall in the north-south street and walked to the front of \nthe school. \n \n0:11:16.2 BL: Or where the statue is?  \n \n0:11:18.0 SV: Yes. \n \n0:11:18.5 BL: Oh, okay. So it's north of that, so that'd be... Okay. \n \n0:11:21.3 SV: Yeah. \n \n0:11:22.0 BL: All right. Okay. And that's the only camera you saw?  \n \n0:11:24.9 SV: That's the only one I saw. \n \n0:11:27.2 BL: All right. Okay. And is that on the opposite side of the building from where the bus \nstop was?  \n \n0:11:32.8 SV: I believe so, yes. \n \n0:11:34.1 BL: Okay. And during that time when you were there with Rodriguez, did she say what \nthe retention period of the videos were?  \n \n0:11:50.5 SV: I don't believe at that time I asked about the retention period. \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 8 of 29 \n0:11:53.1 BL: Okay. \n \n0:11:53.3 SV: We're more focused on just trying to get the camera system up and running. And she \nsaid she'd gimme a call as soon as the camera system was up and running. \n \n0:12:00.5 BL: Oh, okay. Did anyone else... Did she... Did you talk to anyone else at the school \nbesides her?  \n \n0:12:06.2 SV: No, I talked to her. \n \n0:12:07.5 BL: Okay. All right. \n \n0:12:08.9 SV: I know she made some phone calls to IT while we were there. \n \n0:12:12.1 BL: Oh, okay. When was the next time you attempted to get the video?  \n \n0:12:20.8 SV: Probably two weeks later around there. I'm not a 100% sure. \n \n0:12:25.2 BL: Okay. Did you go back out to the school itself or?  \n \n0:12:27.7 SV: I did not go back out to the school, no. \n \n0:12:30.0 BL: Okay. And was that after the July 21st meeting?  \n \n0:12:37.9 SV: July... The meeting with?  \n \n0:12:40.8 BL: With Reber and an investigator, a DA investigator. \n \n0:12:45.5 SV: I believe so. \n \n0:12:46.8 BL: Okay. \n \n0:12:47.6 SV: I believe so. I'm not a 100% sure. \n \n0:12:50.1 BL: Okay. So you didn't go out to the school. So what did you do to try to get the video?  \n \n0:12:55.6 SV: That day that we were there on campus, we walked across the street looking for any \nother camera angles. \n \n0:13:02.6 BL: This is talking about the June 27th. \n \n0:13:04.8 SV: Yes. \n \n0:13:05.3 BL: Okay. All right. \n \n0:13:06.8 SV: And was mainly in phone contact with Marissa Rodriguez at the time, and then I had \nanother case that had come up in that time period as well. So I kind of shifted all my energy to that \nother case. \n \n0:13:24.6 BL: Okay. So your report said that on June 20th, Principal Rodriguez contacted, just \nreading it, contacted me and told me the camera system was fixed. \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 9 of 29 \n \n0:13:38.0 AP: June 20th?  \n \n0:13:40.5 BL: Yeah. Is that a typo?  \n \n0:13:43.0 SV: That might be a typo. Yes. \n \n0:13:44.6 BL: Okay. Do you know what it should be?  \n \n0:13:51.3 SV: Not June 20th, I know that. Yeah, not June 20th. \n \n0:13:57.0 BL: Okay. It could have possibly been just two days later on the 29th?  \n \n0:14:01.5 SV: It is possible. Yes. \n \n0:14:03.1 BL: Okay. All right. Do you remember... 'Cause on your video... Print them. Report. \n \n0:14:15.9 SV: Yes. \n \n0:14:16.5 BL: On June 21st, I'm sorry, July 21st, you were told that the camera system was back up \nand... \n \n0:14:25.0 SV: Up and running. \n \n0:14:26.1 BL: Well, up and running was this one, but that it only had a 30 day window. \n \n0:14:31.3 SV: Retention period, yes. \n \n0:14:32.4 BL: Retention. Is that the first time you were told it had a 30 day window?  \n \n0:14:35.4 SV: From what I remember, yes. I don't know if I asked about it that day when I was \nthere. \n \n0:14:40.9 BL: On the 27th?  \n \n0:14:41.3 SV: On the 27th, talking to the principal. \n \n0:14:44.4 BL: Okay. And this... When you mentioned a time, do you remember that was a phone \ncall or?  \n \n0:14:57.6 SV: I believe so. I believe that's why it's approximate around that time, but I'm not 100% \nsure, but I believe it was... I think I looked at my call log. \n \n0:15:06.4 BL: Oh, on the phone?  \n \n0:15:07.6 SV: Yes. \n \n0:15:08.0 BL: So it could have been a call?  \n \n0:15:08.9 SV: It could have been a call, yes. \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 10 of 29 \n0:15:10.0 BL: Okay. And that's how you got the time for your report?  \n \n0:15:11.6 SV: Call or a text, yeah. Call or a text, one of the two. Possibly a text, actually. \n \n0:15:16.5 BL: Okay. And would that text be on your work phone as well?  \n \n0:15:21.1 SV: From the Principal?  \n \n0:15:22.3 BL: Yeah. \n \n0:15:22.4 SV: No, that would be on my personal. \n \n0:15:24.0 BL: Okay. But this is regarding a work related matter if you got that text. \n \n0:15:29.1 SV: Yes. \n \n0:15:29.6 BL: Okay. Can I do another request for the text of... And this will be more delicate just \nbecause your other text, if it's to her, it could be on a personal level, so redactions are expected, but \njust, hey, the cameras are up and running and a date and time, that's kind of all I need. If that can be \ndone. \n \n0:15:52.9 AP: We can provide that. \n \n0:15:53.8 BL: All right. Okay. And if it's a call log, well, the call that has the date and time. \n \n0:16:00.6 SV: Okay. \n \n0:16:01.1 BL: If it's still there. \n \n0:16:02.1 SV: Yeah, I don't think it is. \n \n0:16:03.3 BL: Okay. So it's a text or call or something. \n \n0:16:05.3 SV: Okay. Sure, not a problem. \n \n0:16:06.6 BL: All right. Okay. So it was... From what Rodriguez had, it was the 29th is when it \ncame up and running and she informed you. And then between then and after your meeting with the \nDDA and the investigator, which was reported on the 21st, was there any other attempts to go to the \nschool and get the video?  \n \n0:16:38.1 SV: No. \n \n0:16:38.3 BL: Okay. Do you know what you were doing or why you didn't go back out there \nduring that timeframe?  \n \n0:16:46.3 SV: Yeah, we had a homicide that occurred. And then I had other cases in the queue as \nwell that I'm trying to juggle. So, I'm just trying to keep my head above water and working on other \ncases, making sure those are going forward and moving. So, it slipped my mind. I mean, that's just \nwhat it came down to, just trying to juggle my work schedule and my workload. \n \n0:17:12.8 BL: Okay. So just workload and could it just slip your mind with the other work duties?  \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 11 of 29 \n \n0:17:16.9 SV: Yes, sir. \n \n0:17:17.8 BL: Just... Okay. \n \n0:17:18.8 AP: Including work on this case?  \n \n0:17:20.0 SV: Including work on this case. \n \n0:17:20.9 AP: Writing warrants, doing myriad other tasks on this case. \n \n0:17:25.5 SV: Yes. \n \n0:17:26.4 BL: Okay. So on the 29th, Reber had a text conversation with you and asked, did VHS, \nwhich is Ventura High School, did VHS call regarding the video? You said, yes, they have the \ncameras up and working, they are making copies and I'm going Wednesday to pick it up. \n \n0:17:49.8 SV: Yes. \n \n0:17:50.3 BL: Okay. This is some screenshots. I was told it was the 29th even though this is not \nnecessarily readable. But does that all look familiar?  \n \n0:18:09.8 SV: Yes, it does. \n \n0:18:11.3 BL: Okay. So from the verbiage of the text and you coordinated with someone at the... It \nseemed like you coordinated with someone who told you the cameras were up and running. Who \nwas that? That was?  \n \n0:18:24.8 SV: Marissa Rodriguez. \n \n0:18:27.3 BL: Marissa Rodriguez?  \n \n0:18:29.3 SV: Yes. \n \n0:18:29.8 BL: Okay. And did she also... Did you confirm with her, please make me copies and \nhave them available Wednesday?  \n \n0:18:38.2 SV: I believe so, yes. I did ask her to just have stuff on standby so I can come by and take \na look and take what I need from that footage. \n \n0:18:45.4 BL: Okay. So just to confirm, you coordinated with Rodriguez to have the video pulled \nup, but did you actually ask her, hey, between this time and this time, make me copies of that \nvideo?  \n \n0:19:02.7 SV: At a later time, I did have, give her an actual time frame of what I needed or the date \nand time of the video. \n \n0:19:09.7 BL: Okay. At a later time?  \n \n0:19:10.7 SV: Yes. \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 12 of 29 \n0:19:10.9 BL: When was that?  \n \n0:19:11.7 SV: I'm not sure right now off the top of my head. \n \n0:19:13.7 BL: Okay. So but as at the time of this text on the 29th, did you coordinate with anyone \nto actually make copies of the video?  \n \n0:19:25.1 SV: I believe it was through phone conversation. I asked her to, at least, have the video \nready and available. \n \n0:19:30.3 BL: Okay. \n \n0:19:31.5 SV: I'm not sure about making copies. I don't remember. \n \n0:19:33.2 BL: Okay. Well, I'm just... You just referenced, they are making copies. \n \n0:19:39.2 SV: Right. \n \n0:19:39.7 BL: And I'm just... \n \n0:19:41.1 SV: I honestly, just a mistake on words at that point to the DA, I'm trying to juggle \neverything that I'm doing. Making phone calls. There was no ill intention to deceive her or anything \nlike that. I'm just trying to barely keep my head above water on this case with the multitude of other \ncases. \n \n0:20:00.3 BL: Okay. So, you didn't mean to convey that you were getting or having her make \ncopies? Or you were... What was your intention by this?  \n \n0:20:12.4 SV: My intention was just to tell her, yes, I'm gonna go back to the high school. The \nvideo system's up and running. I will comb through it and grab what I need from there. \n \n0:20:19.1 BL: Okay. That was what you were trying to convey. \n \n0:20:21.2 SV: Yes. \n \n0:20:22.5 BL: Okay. Did you have an appointment on that Wednesday to pick them up?  \n \n0:20:31.0 SV: I believe I did, yes. \n \n0:20:33.0 BL: Okay. \n \n0:20:34.5 SV: I had verbally confirmed with the principal that I'd be by Wednesday. \n \n0:20:38.5 BL: Okay. Did you go back Wednesday?  \n \n0:20:40.8 SV: I did not. \n \n0:20:40.9 BL: And why was that?  \n \n0:20:41.0 SV: Something else came up at work. \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 13 of 29 \n0:20:43.2 BL: Okay. Okay. And was all this communication with Rodriguez about this video and \nyou going on to her on Wednesday, is that all in text form?  \n \n0:20:57.9 SV: I believe it is. I can't 100% say. I'd have to obviously give you the screenshots and \nstuff. \n \n0:21:03.7 BL: Okay. \n \n0:21:03.8 SV: I believe the majority of it is, yes. \n \n0:21:05.4 BL: Okay, okay, so I'll just, it might be piece mail, but any text communication with \nRodriguez regarding the video, going to the school, attempting to go to the school, rescheduling or \nsomething, I'd like to get a copy of that. And then obviously redact any personal stuff that doesn't \nrelate to what we're talking about. \n \n0:21:25.9 SV: Okay. \n \n0:21:26.7 BL: Okay. Do you know... So on the June 29th was a Thursday of one week, and then \nWednesday was July 5th, the following week. Do you remember why wait from Thursday until \nWednesday to go by and pick it up? Remember?  \n \n0:21:48.0 SV: Like I said, just other cases and just trying to prioritize my time and obviously work \nother cases. \n \n0:21:54.3 BL: Okay. \n \n0:21:55.6 SV: I believe July 4th we actually had our homicide here in the city. It was on the 4th of \nJuly. \n \n0:22:01.4 BL: Oh, it was the 4th of July?  \n \n0:22:03.4 SV: I believe so. I'm not 100%, approximately. \n \n0:22:06.1 BL: All right. I spoke to, I thought it was the 8th, but... \n \n0:22:11.6 SV: That could be the 8th. \n \n0:22:12.8 BL: Okay. \n \n0:22:12.9 SV: I'm sorry. My dates are kinda off. \n \n0:22:14.8 BL: Okay, were you off for that July 4th weekend? Could that have been a cause?  \n \n0:22:21.2 SV: Yeah, I think I was. Yeah, I think I was. I was off. I usually work Monday through \nThursday. I have Friday, Saturday, Sundays off. \n \n0:22:32.2 BL: Oh, okay. 'Cause then Wednesday would have been the July 5th, so July 4th \nweekend was your normal workday or work week. \n \n0:22:41.2 SV: It was my normal workday, so yeah. So I probably was working, but like I said, \nsomething else came up. I really don't remember. \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 14 of 29 \n \n0:22:45.0 BL: Okay, all right. Okay. On July 7th, Reber had... She had a text conversation with you \nin which she said, \"Were you able to get all the video from the high school and the motel?\" And \nthen you answered, \"Morning, I'm off today.\" That would be July 7th. But, \"Morning, I'm off today, \nbut I have video from the school saved and will be combing through it on Monday. As far as the \nmotel thing, only what we have of Martinez.\" So, July, that would be this one right here. \n \n0:23:23.0 SV: Okay. \n \n0:23:23.5 BL: So for the record, I'm just showing July 7th of what I just just read. \n \n0:23:28.2 SV: Okay. \n \n0:23:32.7 BL: So at that time, did you possess a copy of the surveillance video from the high \nschool?  \n \n0:23:37.7 SV: I did not. \n \n0:23:38.0 BL: Okay, and why did you text, \"I have video from the school saved?\" \n \n0:23:45.0 SV: It was a bad text. I should not have sent it. I meant the video was at the school. The \nprincipal and the school had it and had the copy. I had not obtained it physically at all. \n \n0:23:56.6 AP: You used that word copy. It was used earlier. Can you clarify exactly what you \nmean?  \n \n0:24:03.6 SV: The original surveillance video. A flash drive or what we put our videos on to \ncollect. \n \n0:24:08.3 BL: Okay. \n \n0:24:09.7 SV: Or disk. \n \n0:24:11.1 BL: So to confirm, do you know if they pulled that video and saved it for you and it was \nthere at the school? Or is it just that the video footage data is in the computer waiting to get... \n \n0:24:27.7 SV: To be extracted. \n \n0:24:28.0 BL: So is that what you... \n \n0:24:30.6 SV: Yes sir. \n \n0:24:31.9 BL: Okay. So just confirm, no one pulled that video from the time frame that you wish?  \n \n0:24:37.5 SV: No. \n \n0:24:37.4 BL: Okay. \n \n0:24:37.5 AP: That is correct. Nobody pulled it. \n \n0:24:40.2 SV: Yes, that is correct. No one pulled that video from... \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 15 of 29 \n \n0:24:42.3 BL: Okay. All right. What did you mean by, \"I have video from the school saved?\" \n \n0:24:50.2 SV: Exactly what I said that before is that the video was there. I didn't save it physically \nbut it's at the school. It's on the server. It's up and running. It's good to go. \n \n0:25:00.6 BL: Okay. Okay. So the wording, \"I have video from the school saved,\" implies that you \npersonally saved the video. \n \n0:25:06.6 SV: Right. \n \n0:25:09.7 BL: And when you said, \"Will be combing through it Monday,\" means you affirmatively \nknow that you have access to it. \n \n0:25:14.3 SV: Right. \n \n0:25:19.5 BL: And it's waiting for you to comb through it. I'm just... Were you trying to appease \nReber and kind of get her off your back to say, hey, “I got it handled. It's no problem.” Or with all \nintention of going to the school later, but were you trying to just get her off your back and tell her \nsomething that she wants to hear or?  \n \n0:25:42.2 SV: I was trying to, like I said, keep my head above water with the multitude of cases \nand my mind was running a million miles. I obviously had this case, I had other cases in the queue \nthat I was trying to work on, and yes, in a sense I was trying to appease her and just, let, just take a \nbreak, take a space, like breathe. I was a little overwhelmed, a lot overwhelmed. Still am to this day, \nwith a lot of my cases. So by no means was I trying to deceive or lie to her, but I need some help \nand I should have thrown up the white flag to my admin and I didn't, and that's on me. And I should \nhave asked for help. That's what it came down to. \n \n0:26:27.2 BL: Okay. So you said you didn't try to deceive?  \n \n0:26:33.9 SV: No. \n \n0:26:34.5 BL: Okay, but you did try to appease and basically answer her question, get her off your \nback or give... You said, give you time to breathe or something. \n \n0:26:47.5 SV: Just line up what I had to do to get that stuff done, to make sure it's all organized and \ncollected so I can start going and knocking out those check marks and getting everything done. \n \n0:27:00.1 BL: Okay. \n \n0:27:00.4 AP: But you had in fact spoken to the principal... \n \n0:27:01.5 SV: Yes. \n \n0:27:02.5 AP: Confirmed the system was up. \n \n0:27:04.3 SV: Yes. \n \n0:27:06.1 AP: Confirmed it was available. Made a plan to go get it. \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 16 of 29 \n0:27:09.0 SV: Yes. All of those things. That was, while I'm talking to her I'm also talking to the \nprincipal on my other phone trying to get everything in line so I can go pick that up. So I'm dual \ncommunicating, trying to organize both of these things. \n \n0:27:22.6 AP: But in fairness, that's not the same technically as saved. \n \n0:27:26.3 SV: Correct. \n \n0:27:27.9 AP: That said, you confirmed it's available, made a plan to go get it. Now you have \naccess, all of those things. \n \n0:27:37.1 SV: Yes. \n \n0:27:38.5 AP: And miscommunicated that into saved. \n \n0:27:38.5 SV: Yes. \n \n0:27:41.9 AP: But it's not like it made out of whole cloth that you had taken steps to get this video \nand hadn't. You just didn't communicate what you did effectively to the person you're reporting to. \n \n0:27:54.5 SV: Yes. \n \n0:27:54.6 AP: Okay. Go ahead. \n \n0:27:54.7 BL: Okay. So in your opinion, was this text here, \"I have video from the school saved.\" \nWas that a false statement to Reber?  \n \n0:28:12.7 SV: It was a misworded statement to DDA Reber. It was not a false statement. I had all \nintention of getting the video, having it, had access to it. It was just me physically driving down \nthere and getting it. It wasn't to... Just to say it and then never go get it. I had a plan in place to get \nit. I just got swamped with other things here in the city. \n \n0:28:35.2 BL: Okay. So was it just... You had a... I'm just trying to wrap my head around it and \nmake sure I comprehend everything that you're saying. \n \n0:28:46.3 SV: Sure. \n \n0:28:48.1 BL: So was this text that you sent, something that it is... That you are going to do, but \nthen have every chance, every intention of doing it, such as go getting it saved and stuff, but you \nkind of put the, I guess, cart before the horse saying, hey, don't worry, it's done, but you're planning \nto go do it like momentarily?  \n \n0:29:10.9 SV: Yes. \n \n0:29:11.5 BL: Okay. \n \n0:29:12.3 SV: Yes, sir. \n \n0:29:14.0 BL: Okay. So who did you talk to at the school that told you that the video was actually \nthere, saved on the servers or computer or whatever?  \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 17 of 29 \n0:29:29.1 SV: Rodriguez said the video was up and running, which in my mind, I believe it was... It \nwas working. I could go and grab it. I did not know about the 30-day retention period at that time. \n \n0:29:38.5 BL: Oh, okay. Okay. It... On the 29th of... Yeah. You did show, or this came from \nRodriguez anyway, you asked her, “Your video retains for some time” question mark. And then she \nsaid “yes.” So let me just find it here. Okay. So this was on June. This is... She has you as Sean S-E-\nA-N, but... \n \n0:30:18.2 SV: Yes. \n \n0:30:18.3 BL: Okay. She said, hey, yeah, you... Well, I can't read upside... \n \n0:30:23.6 SV: No, right here, sir?  \n \n0:30:25.2 BL: Well, yeah. \n \n0:30:25.9 SV: I'm sorry. \"I won't be there until Wednesday.\" \"Okay. You want to give me another \ncontact and I'll reach out next week? No one in office on Monday. Okay. I'll reach out Wednesday. \nYour video retains for some time?\" She said, \"Yes.\" \n \n0:30:37.7 BL: Oh, okay. \n \n0:30:37.8 SV: I said awesome. \n \n0:30:40.1 BL: So you were kind of coordinating with her when she's gonna be available when you \ncan come down. \n \n0:30:41.9 SV: Yes, sir. \n \n0:30:42.4 BL: And then you asked, it retains for some time and she said yes, but did you ever ask \nhow much time?  \n \n0:30:50.1 SV: I do not believe I asked specifically how much time. \n \n0:30:52.6 BL: Okay. Okay. \n \n0:30:57.5 AP: That text predates this text?  \n \n0:31:01.2 BL: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So he got confirmation that it was retained. I'm just confirming. \n \n0:31:08.3 AP: Right. Yeah, exactly. Yep. \n \n0:31:09.7 BL: I'm just confirming that. Yeah. And so is that where... That's probably... I'm just \nconfirming that's probably where you got that she confirmed that it was saved on their servers. \n \n0:31:24.6 SV: Yes. Or retained. Yes. \n \n0:31:24.6 BL: Retained for some time. Okay. All right, just if you meant that the school had it \nsaved or whatever, why didn't you just say the school had it saved? Or the school is... It's saved at \nthe school?  \n \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 18 of 29 \n0:31:44.6 SV: And to be honest, sir, I was just overwhelmed. Like I said, I've been... I was running \naround on multitude of cases, texting, just overwhelmed. I mean, there's no other word. \n \n0:31:57.1 AP: You should have said it, I confirmed it was saved instead of I saved it. \n \n0:32:00.8 SV: I saved it, yes. \n \n0:32:06.8 BL: Okay. And you said it was going to be, you're combing through it Monday. Did you \ngo on Monday to get the video? That would be July 10th. \n \n0:32:15.4 SV: No. \n \n0:32:16.8 BL: And why not?  \n \n0:32:19.1 SV: We had the homicide on the 8th, so kind of everything shifted to the homicide. \n \n0:32:23.5 BL: Oh, okay. \n \n0:32:23.5 SV: And that was my case as well. \n \n0:32:26.0 BL: Okay. And then on the 10th, you texted with Rodriguez to go back to the school on \nthe 13th. \n \n0:32:39.6 SV: Yes. \n \n0:32:41.3 BL: Just to... Remember that?  \n \n0:32:42.8 SV: Yes. \n \n0:32:46.7 BL: Okay. Let me see here. Okay. Did you go back on the Thursday that 13th?  \n \n0:32:58.4 SV: I don't believe I did, sir. Still working the homicide at that point. \n \n0:33:05.0 BL: Just busy with other cases?  \n \n0:33:06.5 SV: Yeah, just other cases. I mean, you understand with the homicide, it kind of takes the \ncake on all cases. \n \n0:33:12.9 BL: Sure. \n \n0:33:14.4 SV: So at that point, all detectives were focused on that. I'd worked that 8th almost 14 \nhours just out here on the crime scene obtaining video footage, again. And did that with no problem \nand then right into the next day and the next day. \n \n0:33:29.1 BL: Okay. Okay, do you remember talking to Reber on the phone on that Thursday the \n13th about setting up a meeting to discuss the case?  \n \n0:33:41.7 SV: Yes, I do, vaguely. \n \n0:33:43.1 BL: Okay. And did you... But you rescheduled 'cause you were busy on the homicide and \nyou rescheduled?  \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 19 of 29 \n \n0:33:51.4 SV: I believe so, yes. \n \n0:33:52.6 BL: Okay. Do you remember during that call if she mentioned, hey, during this meeting \nthat we're trying to schedule, bring all the evidence to that case, the video, bring the video and bring \nthe evidence. \n \n0:34:08.5 SV: She asked for supplemental reports and I think photographs. I vaguely remember \nthis, but I think I dropped off photographs in her inbox prior to that meeting and outside her door, \nbut I don't remember her saying anything about the specific evidence that... In that case, I thought it \nwas just a meeting to discuss cases. \n \n0:34:29.0 BL: Okay. So just to confirm, you don't remember her requesting, hey, bring the video \nfrom the high school?  \n \n0:34:37.9 SV: I don't, sir. \n \n0:34:39.7 BL: Okay. And that was a phone call. From what I'm told it was a phone call, do you \nremember it being a phone call as opposed to a text or email?  \n \n0:34:48.1 SV: I don't remember having a phone call, but I mean, I've talked... I was talking to her \nfor multiple things on that case, so I really don't recall specifics. \n \n0:34:57.6 BL: Okay. Okay. Do you remember talking about the video at all? Like you're planning \nto go get it or anything like that?  \n \n0:35:06.2 SV: I believe in text message and then I believe I called her when... After we met in \nperson with the investigator and I went to Vons to go try to obtain other video footage in regards to \nthis case or Ralphs. \n \n0:35:25.2 BL: Ralphs. \n \n0:35:26.1 SV: Ralphs, thank you, in Ventura. \n \n0:35:29.5 BL: Okay. On the 14th, I guess it would be that next day, Reber had a text message with \nyou and you two were talking about the Ralphs. But then she also asked, \"Hey, if I request a copy of \nthe high school video, can the court liaison bring it?\" \n \n0:35:51.0 SV: Right. \n \n0:35:51.7 BL: And you said, “no problem.” It's probably that would be on the 14th. Yeah, that \nwould be right down here. \n \n0:36:10.4 SV: Yes. \n \n0:36:10.9 BL: Okay. So she asked to get a copy of the... Now who is it? The court liaison? Is that a \nPD employee that coordinates with the court or who was that?  \n \n0:36:21.6 SV: Yeah, that would be a PD employee, but I think in my mind when she said request a \nschool video, can a court liaison, I wasn't paying attention I thought she meant, can someone go to \nthe high school and pick it up so I just said yeah not a problem. I didn't think and put two and two \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 20 of 29 \ntogether at the time that it was our court liaison. We don't really have a... Well, we do. He's a cadet, \nbut usually if it's evidence like this, we would, we would drop it off or we make a copy, burn it, do \na report on it, and then send it off. \n \n0:36:51.8 BL: Okay, so when she sent this just to confirm your statement, when she asked if she \ncan... If you request a copy of the high school video, she's going to send this request via the court \nliaison. And how did you take that?  \n \n0:37:10.0 SV: I took it as she was going to have someone go to the high school and pick up the \nvideo footage. Don't ask me why, I think I just auto responded with the, yeah, not a problem. \n \n0:37:23.3 BL: Okay, so... Okay, so it was a misinterpretation on your part of what she was asking. \n \n0:37:31.2 SV: Yes. \n \n0:37:31.5 BL: And that's why you said not a problem. Okay. Okay. These are a moot point. These \nare... Okay. Did you think at all about... Well, that you probably wouldn't. Yeah. Did you think \nabout telling her at this point when she's asking, she can get the copy, but just telling her, \"Hey, I \ndon't have it. It's at the high school,” or \n \n0:38:21.3 SV: It didn't cross my mind, sir, it didn't cross my mind. \n \n0:38:25.0 BL: Okay. So from the 13th and well, all up until the 21st, you didn't go back to the high \nschool?  \n \n0:38:34.3 SV: I did not. \n \n0:38:34.8 BL: Okay. All right. And that was due to all your... The how busy you were with other \ncases and such?  \n \n0:38:40.3 SV: Yes sir, and mainly the homicide case. That kind of took over for about a month. \n \n0:38:45.2 BL: Okay. All right. So on the 21st, you met with Reber and investigator Tenille \nChacon?  \n \n0:38:54.8 SV: Yes. \n \n0:38:55.7 BL: Okay. And where was that meeting?  \n \n0:38:57.4 SV: At the DA's office in their conference room. \n \n0:39:00.8 BL: Okay. And during that meeting, you were telling them about the surveillance video. I \nthink you talked about this. A surveillance video at Ralphs you were gonna go get?  \n \n0:39:08.6 SV: Yes. \n \n0:39:10.3 BL: There was a McDonald's in Camarillo also?  \n \n0:39:12.1 SV: Yes. And another officer handled that one. \n \n0:39:14.1 BL: Okay. And then also going to the high school?  \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 21 of 29 \n \n0:39:16.8 SV: Yes. \n \n0:39:18.0 BL: To get it. And during that meeting, did she... Can you tell me how... What the \nconversation was and how that went with her and you regarding the high school video?  \n \n0:39:31.0 SV: I don't really remember the high school video. I remember talking about the case \nitself. We were thumbing through pictures, evidence photos. We served a search warrant. Multiple \nsearch warrants at this point where the crime occurred, where the \n occurred. And then at the \nresidence where it occurred. She was pretty much telling me like, \"Hey, I need more photos,\" I told \nher we would look through... We'd collected a lot of evidence. I was explaining what evidence we \ncollected. \n \n0:39:56.1 SV: Some of the photos that I took weren't the right angles of what she needed in the... \nFor her evidence, she wanted more photos, unfortunately we didn't take more photos. We took what \nwe took, and it was mainly just, I remember her talking about Ralphs, I need to go to Ralphs and get \nthat footage 'cause apparently she... They're a victim and our suspect of can walk into Ralphs, and \nthat was my next stop after I left the DA's office to go to Ralphs. \n \n0:40:22.3 BL: Oh, okay. Okay. And at that 21st meeting, you didn't know, just confirming that you \ndidn't know that the system at the high school had a 30-day retention period?  \n \n0:40:34.8 SV: I don't believe I knew at that time that it had a 30-day retention. \n \n0:40:39.2 BL: Okay. All right. Okay, so then did you go to the high school after the meeting to get \nthe video?  \n \n0:40:51.6 SV: I don't recall if I did. I don't think that day I did. No, I went to Ralphs. \n \n0:40:56.2 BL: You went to Ralphs?  \n \n0:40:57.3 SV: Yes. \n \n0:40:57.8 BL: Okay. \n \n0:40:58.2 SV: I know, I remember going to Ralphs in Ventura down the street. \n \n0:41:01.2 BL: Okay. So I think earlier you mentioned you made phone calls in an attempt to get the \nvideo. \n \n0:41:08.5 SV: Right. \n \n0:41:10.4 BL: Okay. Can you describe those phone calls or texts or... \n \n0:41:13.0 SV: I believe I texted Rodriguez in regards to the video of the angles it captured, and \nthen if the video... The date of the video. And I believe the system was up and working at that time. \nAnd that's when she sent me a photo or screenshot of the angle of what I was looking for. Or let me \nrephrase that. The angle of the camera that was closest to where the victim would've been, at the \ntime of the contact with the suspect. \n \n0:41:40.9 BL: Okay. \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 22 of 29 \n \n0:41:41.8 SV: And then as well as, that's when she... I believe she told me about the retention \nperiod of 30 days. That's when I finally asked, hey, she said it didn't save. I gave her the date and \ntime I needed, and she said it didn't save. \n \n0:41:53.4 BL: Okay. Yeah, I think I saw in here a date and time that you... Oh, this is with... \n \n0:42:02.4 SV: Reber. \n \n0:42:04.9 BL: Reber, but... \n \n0:42:05.2 AP: On the Rodriguez texts, at least... \n \n0:42:08.5 BL: Oh that's right. \n \n0:42:10.7 AP: At least that I his, they showed that whole interaction's there with the screenshot, the \ndate and time. And she says it's gone. \n \n0:42:14.3 BL: Right, right. Okay. Yeah. So on... Right. Yeah. So, you gave her the date and time of \noath then from 0300 to 6:00 PM on the 18th, that's the date of the alleged. \n \n0:42:28.5 SV: Yes. \n \n0:42:29.6 BL: And okay. And then there was the screenshot, is this the screenshot that she sent me \nof the... \n \n0:42:33.0 SV: Yes. Of the camera angle? Yeah. \n \n0:42:35.3 BL: Okay. All right. Good enough. And then from that you texted Reber?  \n \n0:42:44.9 SV: Yes. \n \n0:42:45.6 BL: And told her?  \n \n0:42:47.0 SV: The video did not retain. \n \n0:42:48.1 BL: Did not retain, okay. \n \n0:42:51.2 SV: But also about the camera angle. \n \n0:42:53.0 SV: And about... Yes. About the angle. That is the only angle that would've captured or \nthat we saw that faced closest to where the victim was, but didn't even show where the victim was \nseated from the place described. \n \n0:43:04.5 BL: Okay. \n \n0:43:06.7 AP: And that... Did you also confirm it's a static camera? It doesn't zoom, it just... It is \nwhat it is. That's what it shows 24/7. \n \n0:43:13.7 SV: From what I remember, yes. That's what it shows 24/7, that I believe is the camera \nthat we saw myself and my partner Hector Ramirez, saw when we walked up on the property from \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 23 of 29 \nafar. \n \n0:43:22.6 BL: Okay. And that was on the north corner of that building where the statue is?  \n \n0:43:30.3 SV: Further north of that. So if... Here's the front door of the school with the glass doors \nand we're standing here, it was this building over here, from what I remember. \n \n0:43:39.7 BL: Off to your left as you're facing the building?  \n \n0:43:41.9 SV: Front doors of the main entrance, yes. \n \n0:43:43.9 BL: Yeah. And then the bus stop is to your right?  \n \n0:43:47.2 SV: Yes. From the down. \n \n0:43:48.0 BL: The opposite. So it's on the opposite side of where... \n \n0:43:48.8 SV: Yes sir. \n \n0:43:49.9 BL: The crime occurred. \n \n0:43:51.7 AP: It's behind the building you can see in the screenshot. \n \n0:43:56.1 SV: Yes. So on the other side of that building is where our victim was. This building is \nblocking it, essentially. \n \n0:44:03.7 BL: Okay. All right. And just for the record, we're looking at the video or... Screenshot \nof a text that came from Principal Rodriguez to Virani. \n \n0:44:13.6 SV: Yes. \n \n0:44:13.9 BL: Okay. \n \n0:44:14.6 AP: Screenshot of a text of a screenshot. \n \n0:44:17.0 BL: I know, correct. Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. Words that weren't in the English \nlanguage back then... \n \n0:44:25.2 SV: Right. \n \n0:44:25.8 BL: 30 years ago. \n \n0:44:26.3 AP: Unbelievable. \n \n0:44:28.7 BL: Okay. Okay. So you didn't go... Just to confirm, you did not go to the school. You \njust texted with Rodriguez about what the video showed or not showed and retained or didn't retain?  \n \n0:44:49.0 SV: Yes, sir. \n \n0:44:49.2 BL: Okay. Then after that, do you remember a phone call with Reber about what you \nfound out?  \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 24 of 29 \n \n0:45:03.9 SV: Yes. I was in the Ralphs parking lot, I believe, if I remember correctly. And I text \nher and said the video did not retain, I believe she called me. And she had said, “You told me that \nyou had the video.” At that point I told her, no, the school had the video. I had not picked it up yet. \nAnd that's kind of the gist of what I recall. \n \n0:45:26.0 BL: So when you... When she said, \"Hey, I thought you had the video,\" do you know \nwhat she was talking about?  \n \n0:45:33.4 SV: The high school video. \n \n0:45:34.8 BL: Yeah. Well, yeah. No, but when she said, I thought you said you had already got the \nvideo, do you know what she was talking about as far as how she got that impression that you \nalready said that you got the video?  \n \n0:45:48.9 SV: Yes. Looking back at my texts, I realized that I had said that I had the video. I \nphysically had the video. \n \n0:45:55.5 BL: Okay. When you... \n \n0:45:56.2 AP: Shawn, you didn't say you physically had the video, but it clicked what her... What \nyou had mis-conveyed to her?  \n \n0:46:02.2 SV: Of course, it was. Yes. \n \n0:46:03.4 BL: Okay. And at that time when you had this conversation with her on the 21st, you \nrecalled that text at that time, right?  \n \n0:46:14.1 SV: Yes. \n \n0:46:14.6 BL: Okay. \n \n0:46:15.2 SV: Yes, I did. \n \n0:46:16.2 BL: Okay. And what else did you tell her or?  \n \n0:46:21.9 SV: I believe I told her I was about to walk into Ralphs. I know that, because I'd done \nthat, but... \n \n0:46:25.7 BL: Oh, anything about the text or the fact that you said you had the video saved as \naccording to the text versus you did not get it or any... \n \n0:46:37.2 SV: Yeah. I don't recall what I said verbally over the phone. I know what's on my text for \nme and her, but other than that, no. \n \n0:46:43.8 BL: Okay. But just at the time you, you did click that, that's what she was referring to?  \n \n0:46:47.7 SV: Yes. \n \n0:46:48.2 BL: Okay. Okay. I'm just going over... For the record, I'm just going over my notes just \nthough. \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 25 of 29 \n \n0:47:03.1 SV: No problem, sir. \n \n0:47:06.0 BL: And then during that time, you told her that the area did not capture the area of the \ncrime. The camera angle did not capture the crime?  \n \n0:47:14.6 SV: Yes. From looking at that photo that I was sent by Rodriguez, I did not believe that \ncaptured the correct area of where the victim was. \n \n0:47:20.3 BL: And that was based solely upon what she told you?  \n \n0:47:23.0 SV: Yes. And then also viewing that surveillance camera, remembering where I saw that \nsurveillance camera to actually seeing the angle of it. \n \n0:47:30.2 BL: Right. Okay. And so in your supplemental report, that's what you were referring to \nwhen you said, \"Additionally, the camera angle she showed me would not have captured the area \nthe victim was at,\" which is down there. \n \n0:47:44.3 SV: Yes, sir. \n \n0:47:45.7 BL: So that's in your report you were referring to this screenshot that was sent to you?  \n \n0:47:49.9 SV: I should have been more thorough, yes, sir. \n \n0:47:51.4 BL: But that's what you're referring?  \n \n0:47:52.2 SV: That is what I'm referring to. \n \n0:47:53.0 BL: Okay. All right. So in your report when it says, the camera angle she showed me is \nnot a personal showed because you didn't... \n \n0:48:00.0 SV: No, it was through text. \n \n0:48:01.8 BL: It was just it through the text. Perfect. Okay. Did you ever go from the school if \nyou're at... By the statue, looking at the building, you looked at the one camera off to your left. \n \n0:48:15.1 SV: Right. \n \n0:48:15.8 BL: Did you ever go to the right towards the bus stop and see what cameras are over \nthere?  \n \n0:48:22.6 SV: Yeah, we went to two businesses there. One business was I don't... Interior design \nbusiness, I believe. We walked in there and spoke to someone. The manager, I asked her for footage \nof her camera 'cause she had one camera that pointed out. And she said she would send me \nwhatever footage she would have from the allotted time period. I believe I received that footage. \n \n0:48:47.7 BL: Okay. So that was across the street?  \n \n0:48:50.4 SV: Yes. \n \n0:48:50.7 BL: Oh, okay. \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 26 of 29 \n \n0:48:51.2 SV: We actually went to every business right there. \n \n0:48:53.1 BL: Oh, okay. Got it. Got it. And that was on the 27th?  \n \n0:48:56.4 SV: When we originally went to the school and actually went there. \n \n0:49:00.9 BL: Okay, but I'm talking about going down by the bus stop, not across the street. But \njust in the school area, like on the other side of that building or the parking lot around the corner?  \n \n0:49:11.7 SV: No. \n \n0:49:12.0 BL: Did you go down there see... \n \n0:49:12.8 SV: We did not. Both me and my partner did not. We focused on that one camera north \nof it. \n \n0:49:17.8 BL: Oh, okay. \n \n0:49:18.3 SV: We did not go around the school. \n \n0:49:19.7 BL: Okay. Okay. Did you... Do you know when you were communicating with \nRodriguez about if they had on the 21st, what camera angle does this show? Did you remember \nasking her, what is that camera up on that left side? And specifically ask her about that one camera? \nOr if you asked, hey, does any camera show the bus stop?  \n \n0:49:51.2 SV: I specifically asked about the one camera on the left side. I wasn't focused on the bus \nstop. 'Cause from my understanding, the victim was on a bench in front of the school. That's where \nI understand she was approached by our suspect to the bench. But then later on in the case it says \nshe walked to the vehicle which was pulled alongside. So I was trying to at least get a starting angle \nof where the victim would be. And try to work that way if I could from where that bus, so I can \ncapture everything of her getting up, walking from that bench to the vehicle. And then... \n \n0:50:24.7 BL: Okay. And the bench you're talking about is the bus stop bench?  \n \n0:50:27.0 SV: No, I believed it was the bench in front of the school doors, right there. \n \n0:50:31.5 BL: Oh, okay. So there's another... A bench by the front doors of the school closer to the \nstatue?  \n \n0:50:39.0 SV: Yes. Yes. And the statue is kind of the reference point that in my head, that I was \nlooking for on the video. Anything around that statue or angles of that statue. \n \n0:50:48.3 BL: Oh, okay. Got it. Okay. Okay. Let me see here, but you asked about the one camera. \nDo you remember asking Rodriguez? Oh, first of all, did you ever talk to Villa, Bertha Villa?  \n \n0:51:08.6 SV: I did not. \n \n0:51:10.9 BL: Do you know who she is?  \n \n0:51:12.8 SV: I know she's the assistant principal, but I don't believe I did... I had a communication \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 27 of 29 \nwith her. \n \n0:51:17.1 BL: Well, I guess it would be Rodriguez. And did you ask her, maybe I mentioned this, \nbut is there any other cameras that focused there? Did you ask her that question or is it what does \nthis one camera show?  \n \n0:51:33.4 SV: I believe looking at her screen, I asked her about all the cameras and this is from \nwhat I can recall. \n \n0:51:39.2 BL: Okay. \n \n0:51:39.7 SV: But I was focused on that one camera because that camera faced from north to south. \nSo I believe that would be the best angle. So I was trying to focus on that one. \n \n0:51:45.7 BL: Okay. All right. Okay. So I'm about done here. I think we covered from A to Z. Do \nyou think in all of your communications with Reber, if you... Do you believe that you misled \nDeputy District Attorney Reber in any fashion regarding you obtaining the video?  \n \n0:52:12.5 SV: Not maliciously, no. It wasn't my intention to mislead her. No. I was trying to do the \nright thing at the end of the day and get the footage. I was also swamped. And I just... I was over \nmy head. And I should have asked for help, either the DA's help because they have investigators or \nmy partners. But that, I just tend to take on things by myself and hope that I can do it all. And I had \nworked with her prior to this on this case as well. \n \n0:52:47.8 BL: Reber?  \n \n0:52:48.8 SV: Yeah, Reber. Yeah. On this case, we were writing multiple search warrants for \nresidences all over Oxnard. So I believe I had a good repertoire with her and that... And a good \nworking relationship. I wasn't trying to deceive her or throw the case out. I just got over my head \nand made a mistake as a new detective. And that's what it comes down to. So I learned from it and \nwon't happen again because, like I said, right after this case, I worked on a homicide, no problems \nwith that case whatsoever and multiple other cases I've had no problems with. \n \n0:53:17.6 BL: Okay. All right. And you just mentioned before that you tried to appease her in a \nway to give you breathing room so you can get other stuff done to put this subject off a little bit. \nBut is that correct also?  \n \n0:53:39.4 SV: To give me some space to work is what I was trying to do. I get it. They have their \ndeadlines they have to meet. I have my deadlines I have to meet after that I also have cases I'm \nworking and vice versa. I get it. But I was trying to just create a little space and give me some time \nto get all the evidence that I need gathered so I can present it. \n \n0:53:58.2 BL: Okay. Do you think in all your communication with Reber in any fashion that you \nmade any misleading statements in regards to the area that the camera angles covered or didn't \ncover in relation to the crime area?  \n \n0:54:19.6 SV: No, because that's the only angle that I was given by the principal. \n \n0:54:22.6 BL: Okay. Yeah. And so, you were just relaying what the information you were given?  \n \n0:54:25.8 SV: Yes. \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det. Shawn Virani, 12-13-23 \n \n \n \nPage 28 of 29 \n \n0:54:26.1 BL: Okay. Okay, that's all I have. Do you have any questions or clarifying questions?  \n \n0:54:34.9 AP: Just a couple. Literally just a couple. \n \n0:54:36.9 BL: Yes. \n \n0:54:37.7 AP: When you said... When you sent the text saying that you had the video saved and \nwould be going through it. \n \n0:54:43.4 SV: Yes. \n \n0:54:43.8 AP: By that, when you made that statement, had you already confirmed with Principal \nRodriguez that their video retained for some time?  \n \n0:54:54.3 SV: Uh, for some time, yes. \n \n0:54:57.6 AP: Okay, but in fairness, you didn't drill down as to what that meant?  \n \n0:55:01.2 SV: Correct. \n \n0:55:02.0 AP: But, in your mind, the fact that the video was retained for some time, in your mind, \nis that the same as saved? I.e. It's not at risk of going away?  \n \n0:55:16.4 SV: Yes. Yes. \n \n0:55:19.7 AP: Okay. And you had actually, affirmatively, gone out and confirmed that at least in \nyour own mind, by that time, right?  \n \n0:55:25.8 SV: Yes. \n \n0:55:26.0 AP: Okay. And unartfully as you did, when you told the DA that you had the video \nsaved, were you referring to the actual interaction you had with Principal Rodriguez about the fact \nthat the video retains?  \n \n0:55:45.8 SV: Yes. \n \n0:55:46.1 AP: I.e. Is saved?  \n \n0:55:47.0 SV: Yes. \n \n0:55:52.1 AP: All right. But, in all... But in retrospect, you do see how DA Reber, because of the \nway you communicated with her, was misled. \n \n0:56:04.8 SV: Yes. I do. \n \n0:56:05.9 AP: Was it your intention to mislead her at all?  \n \n0:56:06.8 SV: No. \n \n0:56:10.6 AP: Though, you clearly did have a miscommunication. \n \nVerbatim Transcript of Det.

But, as you sit here today, are you 100% confident that the video has no \nevidentiary value?  \n \n0:56:25.9 SV: Yes. From the angle that I was provided by the principal, yes. I believe it doesn't. \n \n0:56:30.8 AP: All right. All right. \n \n0:56:33.5 BL: Okay. Do you have any closing comments?  \n \n0:56:35.2 SV: No, sir. \n \n0:56:36.3 BL: No. Okay. Good enough.

So, he said he showed up, his apartment was locked, he and his roommate started \narguing, then they start tussling right there, he said he didn’t see anything in his hands.

Then \nthere was the fight and I asked, ‘did you hit him, did he hit you?’ And he said, ‘I don’t know’. I \nsaid it looked like he got hit with something. And now he is not wanting to go to the hospital. We \ndon’t know if it is a 242 and he is a victim of 245, or it’s a mutual 245 or like what? And it’s based \non whatever the witnesses are saying.”  \n \n• 18:15 –\nasks, “Is he giving any information for his roommate?” Officer Askew says, \n“He just says the roommate. Then he says, ‘I don’t know. I don’t know’.

I read\n the Sworn Personnel \nAdmonishment form for Witnesses.\nand I both signed the admonishment form \nand it was uploaded into IA Pro. The following is an “in essence” synopses of the interview. (For exact \nand complete details of the interview, refer to the audio recording.) \n \n \n \nI am the investigative supervisor for 830’s investigation at Mid-City Division. I have been with the \nSan Diego Police Department for 22 years. I didn’t review the reports for this incident, but I did \nreview the BWC.  I was working June 22, 2023, and I was the on-call detective sergeant on that \ndate. I was notified by patrol \nof a 594/245 investigation that occurred at \n.  \n \nThe information that was given to me was there was a subject who was vandalizing a vehicle and \nwas possibly confronted by a subject, maybe possibly the owner. The suspect of the vandalism may \nhave gone after the other person, but the other person from what I understood retaliated and \npossibly beat the suspect for the vandalism. When I was called, they had the suspect of the \nvandalism in custody and it was not known who the other subject was. I was called for advice. At \nthe time my thinking was they had a felony vandalism, so I advised that he could possibly be \narrested for felony vandalism at that time.    \n \nI asked if they were able to determine who the registered owner was of the other car. I was made \naware that the suspect had a roommate, whose car that possibly was. But I was not given any \ninformation on who the roommate was. I think the name was\n but I was told that it was not \nthe same name as the registered owner of the car. I was also told that they called and had made \ncontact with the registered owner of the car and from what I remember there was deniability of \nany information or involvement in that incident. That was pretty much the extent of my \ninvolvement.  \n \nIn my mind, I was believing what they would have had was a felony vandalism.\nasked whether this subject could be arrested, and I said that he could yes. At no point did I tell \nor the officer that they could release the subject at the hospital.  \n \nI had a conversation with\n, shortly after I got a call from Officer Mark Askew, and at \nthat point I was told that he was at the hospital, I believe Officer Askew stated it amounted to a \nmisdemeanor. After reviewing my conversation that is when I thought wait a minute this a \nmisdemeanor and not a felony and that is when I said that yeah, we could do a notify warrant on \nthe subject.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 37 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nInitially, it was\nthat called me but then Officer Askew called me from the hospital. \nThen I notified\nthat I had gotten a call from Officer Askew and I am not sure what \nhappened after that point.  \n \nI just let her know that Officer Askew had called me with this and that yes, he should just be \nreleased on a notify warrant and that we could investigate it later. At the time, I wasn’t even \nlooking at it as a 245. After watching the BWC, I realized what had happened, the extent of the \ninjury and any retaliation from the victim of the car, went far above and beyond what should have \nbeen. And at that point yeah, we could have investigated it as a 245. I was told that the victim did \nincur some sort of injury, but I was unaware of the extent of that injury. I keep going back and \nforth calling him a victim. The suspect of the 594, who was assaulted by the other individual, the \nother individual could possibly be investigated for 245. At the time I wasn’t thinking that, I didn’t \nhave all the information to determine that, and we could’ve investigated it here and opened it up \nas a 245.  \n \nI do not know why Officer Askew did not write a report. I believe this case was handled by the \n810s investigations, so I am not sure the disposition of this case.  \n \nThe interview concluded at 0950 hours.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 38 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nCivilian Witness Interview:   \n \nOn August 14, 2023, at approximately 1504 hours, I interviewed\nat \nScripps Mercy Hospital. I recorded the interview with\n consent.  The following is an “in \nessence” synopses of the interview. (For exact and complete details of the interview, refer to the audio \nrecording.) \n \nFrom what I was told, there were two officers who brought in a patient into our Alpha Pod and \nfrom the start they were immediately like “I have a trauma here, he needs a CAT scan” and they \nwere being very aggressive with staff. The patient was then quickly placed into my room in Delta-\n2. Whenever a police officer brings in a patient they are usually under arrest or on a 5150. I tried \nto ask if they were under arrest. The patient wasn’t in handcuffs, so I didn’t know if he was under \narrest or not. They told me he was not under arrest. And I asked, “okay, well is he on a hold?” \nAnd they told me no. So, I thought, ‘oh okay, so you just transported him’.  \n \nThey then told me the patient had received a head injury and that he was refusing to be \ntransported at the scene by EMS. They were telling me that they were telling the patient that if he \nrefused to be transported by police then they would place him on a 5150 for grave disability.  \n \nAnd so, I went to assess the patient and noticed he was fully alert and oriented. So, I went to them \nand clarified with them that I didn’t think he was holdable.  I was still trying to clarify why they \nwere there, and they were insistent on staying in the room. I just thought, “okay, let’s get the \ndoctor in here and go from there.” I assumed maybe I didn’t fully understand what was going on.  \n \nThen the doctor came in and he was asking the exact same thing. He asked if the patient was \nunder arrest or if he was on a hold and the cop said, “no.” The officer then said, “if he tries to \nleave, we are going to place him on a 5150 for grave disability.” \nsaid, “If you do \nthat, I will discontinue it because he is not holdable. He is oriented, he knows what is going on, \nand he has the right to refuse care.” Then \n made the police officers leave the room \nand close the door for his assessment. And he told them, “You guys can go.” But they were \ninsistent on staying.      \n \nassessed the patient, we talked about what had happened, and we came back out. I \nwas charting at the nurse’s station, and one of the cops kept coming up to me saying, “Is he going \nto get his X-Rays and CT’s yet?” And I said, “the doctor hadn’t put in any orders yet and we were \nwaiting.” Cops don’t usually ask me about patient specific orders, so I thought that was weird.  \n \nThen our charge nurse came around to help clarify because I gave her a heads up that this was a \nweird situation and I didn’t know what was happening. And the patient did eventually get a scan \nand all that. Then our\n, came over again, and asked the officer if he \nwas under arrest and the officer said, “Yeah he is now. He is under arrest for vandalism.”  \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 39 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nAt that point the officer opened the door and yelled out, “Hey man, you are under arrest.” But \nthen they never placed him in handcuffs, I never heard him read the patient his rights or anything \nlike that. Then the patient went to go get a scan and he came back. The nurse practitioner went to \nsew up his head and then the cops were gone. They left without saying anything to anyone and to \nme it seemed like the patient was never under arrest. It was just really weird, and they were pretty \naggressive with us. They were verbally aggressive, and they kept walking up and getting right into \nmy face and asking, “When is he getting his CAT scans?” \n \nOne officer was more aggressive than the other, but they were both on the same page. They both \nkept switching out. One of the officers was named Askew, I don’t remember the other officer’s \nname. I couldn’t tell you what they looked like, but I know one of them was white.  \n \nThey were asked to leave by the doctor, and then the doctor told the patient that he could ask the \nofficers to leave. But the patient appeared to be scared. He was like a young guy, and I just think \nhe was kind of scared of them. So yeah then they just stayed.  \n \nThey refused to leave, and they said they were not leaving. They said, “We are not leaving, we are \ngoing to put him on a hold if he tries to leave.” But the doctor kept saying, “This does not make \nsense.” But then he got sick of fighting with them, so he just left it alone.  \n \nI asked if the patient was under arrest or on a 5150 and they both said no. The doctor also asked \nmultiple times. The charge nurse also asked. I don’t believe anyone else asked. It wasn’t until the \ncharge nurse asked that they said he is under arrest. I am not sure the exact time they were at the \nhospital. I would have to look. But I would say at least a couple of hours. At least an hour, \nprobably more. But yeah,\ncomes on at 7PM for nights and I worked till 9PM and the cops \nwere gone a little after 9PM. This occurred in Delta-2.  \n \nThey walked in through Alpha Pod first, which is where all the paramedics come in and its usually \nwhere cops bring in patients. And from the start they were like, “I have a trauma patient, I need a \nbed, and he needs a CAT scan,” and they were just yelling at people who happened to be standing \nthere. We were thinking, “Whoa! … get him registered and we’ll figure it out.”  \n     \nI never saw the patient in handcuffs at any point. The patient never seemed to want to leave. He \nwas fine being medically treated. The patient told me afterwards that he had refused EMS because \nhe didn’t have insurance and that he was afraid because he wouldn’t be able to pay for it.  It \nseemed to me afterwards that maybe the cops gave him free transportation to the hospital? But \nthen they just weren’t leaving.  \n \nI reported this incident to my manager. Well the charge nurse and then to \n The officers got \nin my face, not the doctors face. I was standing at the nurse’s station and there was a barrier in \nbetween us, and the officer was just hovering over the nurse’s station and I would say he got \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 40 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

I think both of them got in my face at one point. One was definitely more \naggressive then the other. The white guy was the more aggressive one. I don’t remember if it was \nAskew, I don’t remember his name.  \n \nThey weren’t yelling, but like I am trying to remain calm and I am a little worked up because you \nknow they are police officers and I am trying to explain that the doctor hasn’t put in the order and \nif he does then he will go to CAT scan, but it hasn’t been ordered at this time. Then they walked \nback to the room and then they keep looking at me. It was intense.  \n \nWhen the doctor asked them to leave the examination room, the officers just stood right outside \nthe room. When the doctor first went into the examination room is when he asked the officers, “Is \nhe on a hold? Is he under arrest?” The doctor then said, “You guys have no reason to be here \nthen, and you guys can go off and do something else. I don’t know why you are here.” And when \nthey refused, he said, “Well, the least we can do is give him some privacy, so we are going to \nclose the door.” And they were like, “Okay”, and they walked out and stood just outside the door.  \n \nI didn’t ask them to leave, but I asked them why they were still there. They told me, “We are going \nto put him on a hold if he leaves. We need to stay with him.” They at least said they were going to \nput him on a hold at least 3-5 times. Anytime we were questioning them they kept saying that. \nWhich we were like that doesn’t make sense, he is fully oriented and not holdable.  \n \nI think the doctor was the only one who asked them to leave, and I was there, and I heard that \ninteraction. They weren’t ordered to leave the hospital, but the doctor did suggest they should \nleave. I mean I don’t think anyone wants to tell cops what they need to do.        \n \nI think the whole thing was pretty unprofessional. They refused to leave, they were coming in so \nhot, they were asking me a lot about what orders were ordered and why orders weren’t ordered. \nYou know they aren’t medical professionals and it was weird.  \n \nThe interview concluded at 1518 hours.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 41 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

I recorded the interview with\n consent.  The following is an “in \nessence” synopses of the interview. (For exact and complete details of the interview, refer to the audio \nrecording.) \n \nI was working on June 22, 2023, and I remember SDPD officers coming to the hospital with a \npatient. The police escorted the patient into the emergency room. Initially on their arrival we \nasked if the patient was under arrest and they said, “no”. We asked them a few times and they \nwere consistently saying, “no”. The officer told me that the patient did not want to be transported \nby ambulance due to the cost. So, they offered to basically give him a ride to the hospital. That \nseemed unusual to me and I had never seen that in my experience. And I thought it was interesting \nthat they decided to stay with him. From my experience when the police are with a patient it is \nbecause they are under arrest or on a 5150 hold.  \n \nThen the officers were talking to the patient and it seemed like things were getting a little more \nheated. The patient got a little defensive and it seemed like maybe I hadn’t received the whole \nstory. So, I was just kind of keeping an eye on them because it seemed different from my previous \nexperience.  \n \nAt one point the doctor came in and had to ask the officers to leave multiple times during the \ntreatment. They were hovering and it was making a lot of the staff uncomfortable. There was \nsomething about … I don’t know if it was stolen property or not, but it seemed like they were \ntrying to get a confession out of the patient or something like that. And the patient was getting a \nlittle more aggressive and he was saying he wanted to leave. And the police were saying that if he \ndid, they were going to place him on a 5150 for grave disability. The doctor had told them at that \ntime, that he would discontinue the hold immediately if they decided to do that.  \n \n \nAt the end of the visit, I don’t know if the patient ended up being arrested. It was very unclear if \nthe patient was under arrest. Because like I said at the very beginning, they were very clear that \nhe was not under arrest then they began talking about placing him on a hold. At one point, now I \nam certain of it, they did tell him he was under arrest. I don’t think he was ever in handcuffs, and \nto my knowledge they never read him his rights or anything like that. And I can’t remember if they \nleft with him or not.  \n \nI remember it taking a long time for the whole treatment process and the officers were getting \nimpatient. They were very frequently asking myself, the nurse, or the doctor if the patient was \ngoing to receive a CT or X-Rays of his head. They were asking why he hadn’t received treatment \nso far, and they were a little bit inappropriate in their line of questioning. It was inappropriate \nbecause it wasn’t an innocent question like, “Is he going to receive this kind of treatment?” It was \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 42 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nmore like why he hasn’t received this treatment, he needs this, this, and this. And the doctor was \ntelling them, “no he doesn’t” and it was kind of like that.   \n \nI personally asked if the patient was under arrest and they told me no in the beginning. I also \nasked if he was on a 5150 and they told me no. They were asked multiple times by both me and the \nother nurses. I can’t be sure on how many times they were asked those questions, but I know I \nasked, his nurse asked, and I think the doctor asked. I would say they were asked a handful of \ntimes, like maybe 5 times.  \n \nWhen the patient and the officers were having the heated conversation, I didn’t hear the whole \nthing because I was at the nurse’s station. I heard a portion of it, but I don’t remember everything \nthat was said. I believe the patient asked to leave, I believe so. We obviously as a medical staff \nencourage him to stay to receive treatment. The police were also encouraging him to stay, maybe \ncoercing him, I don’t know.  \n \nI believe the officers were there for the entire stay, maybe several hours. I never asked them to \nleave. The doctor asked the officers to leave the patients room only during treatment. I don’t think \nthey were ever asked to leave the hospital.  \n \nI would say I was uncomfortable with the officer’s presence and behavior. I was more \nuncomfortable for the patient. I was not uncomfortable for myself. I was uncomfortable with the \nfact that they were going back and forth on whether the patient was there on his own volition or \nwhether he wasn’t. At some point I heard them say he is now under arrest and I don’t know what \nthe arrest was for. When he was placed under arrest the patient appeared very confused and upset \nby that. He was trying figure out why he was under arrest, what he had done, and trying to figure \nout what had changed since the beginning.  \n \nI don’t remember how it concluded. It must have been change of shift for them or something \nbecause it was getting kind of late and they were asking how long it was going to be. They were \nwanting to know if they needed to swap out with other officers so they could go home and someone \nelse could stay. I believe they left without him and he remained at the hospital, but I can’t say for \nsure.  \n \nI don’t remember the officer’s names or what they looked like. I would say the officers were a bit \naggressive towards the staff. They would just come up to us frequently and I would say they were \njust very demanding. They would say, “He needs this type of treatment.” And it was crossing the \nline when they began demands involving medical decision making. Their involvement with him \nwas more than just giving him a ride. I didn’t see the officers get in anyone’s face or say anything \ndiscourteous.  \n \nThe interview concluded at 1533 hours.  \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 43 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Due to time constraints\n did not have much time to talk and therefore the interview \nwas not recorded and was limited in detail.  \n \n stated that he vaguely remembered the incident involving the SDPD officers.\n \nstated he remembered asking the officers to step outside the exam room so he could \nspeak with the patient alone. He stated the officers had no business being in the exam room and he \nhad to adhere to HIPPA laws.\nstated the officers complied with his request. \n \nstated the interaction with the officers was odd and he remembers the officers being \noverly obtrusive and he couldn’t figure out why. He confirmed the patient wasn’t under arrest and \nhe wasn’t on a 5150. He advised the officers they would treat the patient and they were free to \nleave. He remembers the officers wanting to stay and not leaving.  \n \nnoted the patient was making reasonable decisions on his own. He doesn’t \nremember whether the patient was brought to the hospital in handcuffs. He doesn’t remember the \nofficers placing the patient under arrest at any point.  \n \nreiterated that the interaction with the officers was odd as they were inquiring about \nthe patient getting a CT scan. He stated it felt like the officers were telling him how to do his job, \ndespite not having any training and it wasn’t their profession. He stated the patient did not meet \nthe requirements for a CT scan as he had never lost consciousness.  \n \nstated the officers were not aggressive, but their presence was overbearing. He \nstated he had minimal interactions with the officers because he oversaw the E.R. and his \ninteraction with the patient was limited. He stated his nurses and staff would have interacted with \nthe officers much more. He does not recall the officers yelling or acting discourteous.  \n \n does not recall the officers threatening to put the patient on a 5150 and doesn’t \nremember telling the officers if they placed him on a 5150 then he would immediately release the \npatient. \n  \nThe interview concluded at approximately 1140 hours.  \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 44 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

I recorded the interview with\n consent. The following is an “in essence” synopses of \nthe interview. (For exact and complete details of the interview, refer to the audio recording.) \n \nI was working on June 22, 2023, and the one thing I observed is that when the patient was brought \nback into the pod and into the room there was an exchange that took place between the officer and \nthe ED doctor. It sounded like the officer wanted to place the patient on a hold even though he \ndidn’t qualify for one and the ED doctor said well if you do that, I am basically going to \ndiscontinue the hold. That is as much as I saw of the encounter.  \n \nI didn’t hear any voices raised but they just went back and forth. And the doctor just said, “I am \nthe ED doctor and I am just going to discontinue the hold.”  \n \nI don’t remember hearing the officer say the patient was or was not under arrest. To my \nknowledge the patient was not on a hold when he was brought here. I don’t remember him in \nhandcuffs initially, but when I took over as the patient’s primary nurse he was not handcuffed.  \n \nThe patient was coherent and was able to make decisions for himself. He was able to call for a \nride to have a friend come pick him up.  \n \nI didn’t witness any altercations myself dealing with the officers. I just know what was told to me. \nI never witnessed any discourteous behavior.  \n \nThe interview concluded at approximately 1908 hours.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 46 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

I am just letting you know what she told me.  I \nguess they wanted to put him on a hold because he had refused to go by ambulance to the hospital, \nand the patient had just expressed he just didn’t want to go by ambulance because he didn’t want \nthe bill.  \n \nSo anyway, no one was sure if he was under arrest or not. So, I just walked over, and I asked him \na question but, in a way, where it didn’t seem like I was prying. I don’t remember what the \nquestion was, but it was about the situation. Then\nwas still upset, and she said she was \ngoing to write this email and she asked if that was okay. And I told her to write the email and that \nshe could include me in the email.  \n \nSo, I asked him if he was under arrest and it was a different officer there at that time. So now there \nare two officers. When I asked if he was under arrest the other officer said, “Well he is now.” I \ndidn’t write down the other officer’s name, but the one causing all the issues up to that point had \nbeen Askew. I can’t say the other officer was not causing any issues, but he just showed up later. I \nbelieve \nsaid both officers made her feel uncomfortable. Askew is the one who initially \nbrought in the patient though.  \n \nI left and came back and then I asked the officers what the patient was under arrest for. The other \nofficer said he was under arrest for vandalism. That was pretty much all the interaction I had with \nthe officers.  \n \nBut then when they left \ntold me this guy wasn’t under arrest, then he was under arrest, \nbut they never read him his rights and they never handcuffed him and then all of a sudden, they \nleft.  \n \nI never saw the patient handcuffed. I never asked the officers if he was on a 5150. I only interacted \nwith the patient to ask him what was going on and then heard him when he told me that he just \nwanted help. He was alert and was able to communicate for himself.  \n \nI assumed when the officer brought him in it was just a jail clearance. But usually during a jail \nclearance they are cuffed when they come in. I don’t remember if he was cuffed when he came in. I \nassumed it was a jail clearance because officers are generally here for a jail clearance or a hold.  \n \nI don’t know if the officer was acting inappropriately but he was acting rude and confrontational. \nThe way Officer Askew spoke to me and his tone of voice. At first, he was very confrontational \nwhich was seen through his body language and him telling me what to do basically. He was \ngetting annoyed. He wasn’t ordering me around, but he was telling me what to do like, “You need \nto take him,” and “He needs a CAT scan.” That is no one’s call but the doctors. He wasn’t \ninappropriate just rude. He was argumentative. He only argued with me for a few seconds, but he \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 47 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

I would say \nhe was discourteous.  \n \nI was not present when the officer interacted with the doctor. That was \n I don’t believe  \nthe officers were asked to leave the hospital.

I recorded the interview with\nconsent.  The following is an “in \nessence” synopses of the interview. (For exact and complete details of the interview, refer to the audio \nrecording.) \n \nI was working on June 22, 2023. I was in Alpha, where everyone comes in, near the ambulance \nbay. I was one of the first \nthat met the officer. The officer was bringing the patient in and \nthe patient had blood everywhere and he was handcuffed. And I think the officer was just trying to \nexpedite care. He rudely came up and started barking orders at me. He barked out, “We need to \nget this guy in a room. He needs CT scans.” We told him he needed to register the patient first. \nThere is a door where he needed to go and next to it, he could register the patient. I told him, “I \nam not the charge nurse, let me go get the charge nurse.” And he stepped back, and he just waited \nthere for a little bit. The patient just stood there and was quiet. The officer was just being rude to \nall the staff. Then he came back up again and asked, “Are we going to get a room?” I advised him \nwe had to wait.  \n \nFinally, I went over to go get the charge nurse and I let her know that there is an aggressive \nofficer here, that needs a room for this guy who looks pretty banged up. I had already told him to \nregister the patient. He wanted to basically bypass the process by putting him in a room, getting \nhim scanned, and then taking him to jail or whatever, that was like his goal. Yeah, he told us he \nwas going to arrest him. I don’t remember the exact words he used; this was like two months ago. \nI just know he was telling us what to order. He said, “CT scan, X-Ray, you need to clean him up \nso we can arrest him.” Basically, he was just telling us what to do.    \n \nThen \n finally came over. I went over there twice, and she was busy. That is when \ntold the officer, “you are not a doctor” and told him that we had to wait to see a doctor before we \nput orders in. And that is when the officer said, “Well I know what he needs” or something like \nthat.  \n     \nThe patient was not brought behind the desk. But there is a computer on the side of the desk and \nthe patient was brought over to that side. It was pretty close to where I was. Closer than arm’s \nlength. He \n was brought pretty close to where we were.  \n \nWhen he came into the hospital the patient was definitely in handcuffs. I never saw any officers \ntake him out of handcuffs. Every time I saw the patient, he had handcuffs on. He might not have \nhad handcuffs on when he was roomed, because I saw him later, but when he was brought into \nAlpha Pod, he had handcuffs on the entire time.   \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 49 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nI did not ask if the patient was under arrest. I mean he was already in handcuffs, so I never asked \nany of that. I never asked if he was on a 5150 either.  That’s the thing, I couldn’t ask him anything. \nHe basically just came up and started telling us what to do. We were never given an opportunity to \nask any questions.  \n \nWhen we told him to get the patient registered, I don’t remember what he said. I just know that he \nnever went and got the patient registered. He didn’t listen to our instructions, and he just stayed \nwhere he was at. The issue was he was not listening. He just kept trying to force us to do things \nthat were out of our scope of responsibility. I am not the charge nurse. I kept telling him I have to \nget the charge nurse. And then when\n came over, she explained that to him too. She advised \nthe officer that we could room the patient, but we could not put orders in. The doctor had to come \nand see the patient first.  \n \nWhen he entered the hospital there was no conversation ahead of time. He just came right up to us \nand just started barking orders. He wasn’t argumentative, but his tone was just very rude. He was \nvery aggressive. He wasn’t raising his voice, but he did have a strong voice. He was 100% lacking \npeople skills. He just seemed like he was in a bad mood, let’s just put it that way. \n \nI don’t know if that is how he is normally, let’s just put it that way. I don’t know what happened \nbefore he brought the patient in, but he was basically just telling us “look at him. He is all banged \nup and needs to get taken care of now.” And there is a process, you must wait and there are other \npatients waiting and you just can’t come in making demands.  \n \nWhen he came in and brought the patient right up to me, I asked him to place the patient \nsomewhere else. There is a room to register the patient with a chair that’s by the registration \noffice. I told him you can wait there to register him, and where you are done there is a phone you \npick up to call the charge nurse. He just didn’t listen to any of that stuff. That is when I went over \nto go get \n The interaction wasn’t long, but because he was so forceful and aggressive, I \nwas just trying to get \nover there to talk with the officer. The interaction might have been \nlike 5-10 minutes at most.    \n \nI was there when he interacted with\nand when she told him that she was not the doctor. He \nwas telling her the same thing that he told me that the patient needed CT scans, X-Rays, and that \nhe needed to get cleaned up.  \n \nI think he came in with another officer. I don’t remember either of their names.  \n \nAfter \n spoke with him, then the patient was placed in a room. They found a room for him \nquickly. I was then no longer in contact with the officer or the patient. I saw the patient later and \nhe was in a room sitting without handcuffs on.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 50 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

But he 100% was able to make decisions for himself, he was \narticulate and with it. He was just banged up. And I knew the story of how it happened.

I recorded the interview with\n consent. The following is an “in essence” \nsynopses of the interview. (For exact and complete details of the interview, refer to the audio recording.) \n \nI was working the night in question, and I briefly and vaguely remember the officer that brought in \nthat patient. He wasn’t my patient, but I do remember having a few interactions with the officer. I \ndo remember him coming in through the ambulance bay which is where SDPD typically brings in \npatience on 5150s or whatever the case maybe. I don’t know if the officer just didn’t know the \nprotocol or how to check in a patient, but he immediately came to the nurse’s station desk and he \nbegan demanding a room for the gentleman he had brought with him. This was in the Alpha Pod, \nand I remember the patient being handcuffed, but it was awhile back so I couldn’t say for sure. I \ndon’t recall the nurses who were at the station with me at the time the officer brought in the \npatient. But I do remember him being handcuffed.  \n \nSo, I remember him coming in and making demands to get him and his patient a room. He didn’t \ngive us any information about why he was there or if he was on a 5150. Without any information \nhe just began demanding a room from us. We educated him on the proper protocol which is to \npick up the phone in Alpha pod and to call our charge nurse and to go over the reasons of why he \nis bringing in a patient. And then the charge nurse will come over and assign a room if there is \none available at the time. And I remember a little bit of resistance from him and he was pushing \nback asking why we couldn’t put the patient straight into a room and at that point the charge \nnurse came over and began handling it so I just stepped back and let them do their thing.  \n \nI don’t recall any demands he made regarding the specific medical treatment of the patient. I was \nunsure at the time whether the patient was on a 5150 or under arrest. I later found out that he was \nnot on a 5150 or under arrest and that is when a lot of us started questioning why this officer is \nhere. We thought it was very unusual and we were very confused especially because the officer \nwas hovering around the patient for most of his visit.  \n \nIt was awhile back, but the officer’s demeanor, I don’t want to say it was hyperaggressive, but it \nwas definitely more assertive then necessary. It didn’t feel like he was asking for help or telling us \nwhat was going on, it was more like, “I am here. This is what I need. I need it now.” That was \nwhat was communicated through his words and his body language. As far was what he \nspecifically said I definitely would not be able to recall that.  \n \nI would describe his behavior as argumentative. When we told him how to check in the patient, he \nwas not initially compliant with our instructions. All I can say is that he seemed to be a little more \nunderstanding once the charge nurse showed up to explain the process to him herself.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 52 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nPast that point I didn’t have any further interaction with him directly. But later in the night, I was \nwalking through Delta Pod and briefly witnessed him having an interaction with another\n \nThe\n. And I was just walking by, but I remember her body language looking \nvery uncomfortable, and me in my head saying I should check on her later to see what is going on. \nAn hour or two later on in the night she actually approached me looking very emotionally \ndistressed and she told me she felt very uncomfortable with the way the officer was speaking with \nher. She didn’t feel it was professional or appropriate how the officer was hovering over the \npatient or even why he was there in the first place. Again, we were all very confused by that.  \n \nI only remember seeing the patient during the intake. I never saw the patient once he was assigned \nto his room. \n \nThe officer was never yelling, but his delivery felt more aggressive than necessary. I don’t recall \nthe officer bringing the patient to the nurse’s desk. I don’t believe so, but I don’t recall. I think he \nhad the patient stand against the wall, but that could just be one of the million SDPD intakes that \nwe come across on a daily basis that I am mixing it up with.  \n \nI just remember how distressed and uncomfortable our co-worker \nwas. When I was \npassing by it was less than 7 seconds. In terms of proximity he wasn’t super close. This is just my \npersonal opinion, I feel like when you are 6’-03”, he is a built guy, and he has a very intimidating \nlook about him. If that was me, I wouldn’t be standing within the proximity that he was to her, just \nbecause I would try to be aware of my body language around others. In that sense, I do feel like he \nwas standing kind of close, he was hovering over her. If I were her, I also probably would have \nfelt pretty intimidated, but that is just my personal opinion.  \n \nI would describe the officer as discourteous. It didn’t feel like he was on our team. Typically, when \nofficers bring in patients we try to operate as one team, because in theory we are all there for the \npatient’s best interest. But it didn’t really feel like that. I actually remember thinking this based on \nhow he was acting; it felt like he had a reason of his own to be there and it wasn’t to help the \npatient. I don’t even know what I mean by that. I just know it was weird with how long he stayed. I \nmean officers who bring someone in on a 5150 don’t generally stay that long. He stayed at least \nan hour or two. I kind of got caught up with my own patients but the whole thing was just really \nstrange.  \n \nThe interview concluded at 1954 hours.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 53 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

I recorded the interview with\n consent.  The following is an “in essence” synopses \nof the interview. (For exact and complete details of the interview, refer to the audio recording.) \n \nI just remember the nurse next to me was in an argument with the officer because the officer kept \ngoing back and forth on whether the patient was going to be arrested or not. And they kind of \nwanted to place him on a hold, and the doctor said he was going to DC it, if the officer tried to put \nhim on a hold. The nurse the officer was talking to was \n.   \n \nI observed the back and forth with \nand apparently there had been issues prior involving \nother nurses when the patient was brought in initially. They eventually brought the patient to Pod \nD and then the officer came out and began to argue with the nurses at the nurse’s station here.  \n \nI don’t remember if there were two officers or not. I think there might have been two. I don’t \nremember what they looked like. I don’t remember if the patient was handcuffed at all.  \n \nI can’t say whether the officer was being discourteous at all. I never heard any yelling or anything \nlike that. I just know there was a back and forth over the officer threatening to place the patient on \na hold. I think he just made it seem like he could get the orders that he wanted when it was \nobviously up to the doctor. So, I don’t know if he just didn’t know how things worked around here. \n \nHe wasn’t trying to fact find, they were arguing. The \n, and the officer were the ones \narguing. I only saw like 30 seconds to a minute maybe. I walked away while they were still \narguing. I was doing other things while that was occurring.  \n \nI don’t recall the officer saying the patient was not under arrest. I remember them saying they \npossibly would arrest him, so I guess then I would say yeah. I heard the officer both threaten \narrest and threaten placing the patient on a 5150.  \n \nThe patient was alert and able to make decisions for himself. I don’t know if the officers were ever \nasked to leave at any point. I saw the officers interact with the doctor, but I never saw them argue \nwith the doctor. The only thing I remember is that the doctor said he would DC the hold. But I \ndon’t know if the officer was still standing there or not. You know what? Now that I think about it \nhe did argue with the doctor too. I do remember he walked up, and they were bickering for a \nminute. I never saw the cop yelling, but the doctor walked up to make a point by saying that he \nwas the doctor and he was the one who made decisions. I didn’t hear the officer’s response. \n \nMy interaction with the officer was fine to be honest. I remember discharging the patient and that \nis how I got involved in this. But when I talked with him, he was fine. I just know how he was \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 54 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

I \nreviewed my BWC and I reviewed my officers report (Arjis-9), from this incident.  \n \nI was working second watch Mid-City patrol on June 22, 2023. This was an overtime assignment. \nOn that date I responded to a 415V call at Pershing and University Avenue. The details of the call \nstated there was a male swinging a golf club at cars and also at the front door of a residence.  \n \nWhen I arrived on scene, my initial role was to see if there were any victims or suspects and upon \narrival there was an officer that already had someone detained. I remember that subject was \nbleeding form his head. That officer then directed me to go with the sergeant.\nthen \npreceded to tell me that another involved party was seen running eastbound on Wightman … I \nthink it was. So, I checked the area for any involved parties or suspects. \n \nAfter I checked the area, we did as a team assist\nwith clearing the residence. After \nsearching the building, I turned off my body worn camera because it felt like the investigation was \ndone and there was no longer going to be any enforcement action taken.  \n \nAfter I turned off my camera, I did take a witness statement from a gentleman that lived across the \nstreet from the incident. I asked him what he saw. He basically said that there were two parties \ninvolved in a fight and that he identified the primary aggressor as having a metal object in their \nhand. He stated they fought with each other and they were last seen going east on Wightman.  \n \nFrom my report I can’t decipher if the person we had detained was the primary aggressor or not. I \ndidn’t get that far with anyone on the scene.  \n \nI never determined what type of crime had occurred. I don’t know if a crime of vandalism \noccurred and I don’t know if a crime of assault with a deadly weapon occurred.  \n \nI never came into contact with \n, but if he was the one who was detained, I did see \nblood coming from his head.

(For exact and complete details of the interview, \nrefer to the audio recording.) \n \nI am currently assigned to Mid-City Division working 2nd watch. I have been a police officer for \napproximately 4 ½ years. I did not have BWC for this incident. I did review my arrest report. I \nwas working on June 22, 2023, and I was working Mid-City patrol on 2nd watch. I was working as \na single officer unit.  \n \nOn that date, I responded to a radio call at Pershing Avenue and University Avenue. I arrived on \nscene around 1907 hours. I believe the call was a violent disturbance call. The details on the call \nstated there were two males fighting near an apartment complex. One had a golf club or some \nkind of stick. Officer Askew was also assigned to that call. I responded to where Officer Askew \nwas.  \n \nOfficer Askew had a male detained named\n. The male was detained for probably \nbeing one of the participants in the fight. Medics were treating the male when I arrived. He had \nsome lacerations to his arms and lacerations to his head as well. I don’t recall if Officer Askew \ntold me that \n was a victim of 245. I don’t recall Officer Askew telling me \nwas a \npossible suspect for 242. Aside from the male that was detained there were no victims present. At \nthat point the male was not under arrest and I believe we were still investigating what was going \non at the scene.  \n \nI heard the detained male tell Officer Askew that he was refusing to be transported by ambulance \nbecause he could not afford the bill. I heard the detained male say that he would like to wait for a \nfamily member or take an Uber before he received treatment for his wounds. I don’t specifically \nremember the detained male asking if he could take an Uber. I don’t recall hearing if Officer \nAskew told the detained male that he could not take an Uber or could not have family member \npick him up. I don’t recall hearing\nsay that he knew his rights and knew he had a right to \nsay no to medical treatment.  \n \nI did have a conversation with the detained male, and I encouraged him to go to the hospital. I \nbasically told him that because of his wounds he should probably go to the hospital and get \nchecked out. I advised him he had open lacerations and that those could get infected. His general \nresponse to me was that he did not want to be transported by ambulance because of the fees.  \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 60 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \n \nI believe Officer Askew had a conversation with\nregarding how the case was going \nto be documented. I believe we were still trying to identify the other parties involved and we were \nstill searching for the other half. I think we were just trying to determine what type of crimes we \nhad at that point.  \n \nI don’t recall Officer Askew telling me that per his conversation with \nwas a \nvictim of 245. I believed at that time\nwas a suspect for vandalism. I believed \nused a golf club to smash out the rear taillights of his roommate’s car. We could not ascertain the \ncost to repair the damage because we did not have a victim present. I would estimate that it was \nless than $1000. I believed it was a misdemeanor vandalism.  \n \nI don’t specifically remember Officer Askew saying anything about \nbeing a victim of 245. \nI don’t specifically remember asking Officer Askew if we wanted to take the male out of handcuffs. \nAt this point \nwas lawfully detained. I believe that prior to his transport we were still \ntrying to determine the nature of the crime and that if he was to be arrested for a crime what \ncrime he would be arrested for.   \n \nI did hear Officer Askew tell \nthat he was either going to be going to the hospital in an \nambulance or he was going to be coming with us to be treated for his injuries.\nstated \nagain that he was not going to go in the ambulance. I don’t remember if Officer Askew asked if \nwould then agree to be transported in the back of a patrol car. I don’t remember\never saying he was willing to go in the back of the patrol vehicle to be treated for his injuries. \n \ndid AMA with medics. I did tell Officer Askew that I was concerned with transporting \n I was concerned because of the wounds and the injuries he had sustained. I believed that \nmedical transport would probably be necessary. He could then be monitored in the back of an \nambulance instead of being transported in the back of a patrol car. I don’t remember saying \nanything about liability to\n. But I do remember telling\nthat I was \nconcerned that\ncould possibly die in the back of a patrol vehicle. I did hear the medics \nsay that unfortunately the patient had the right to refuse medical transport.\ndid say \nthat we needed to take him to the hospital. I agreed with that decision because I believed he \nneeded medical treatment. I believed at that point\n and \nhad discussed \nand communicated the facts of this case.  \n \nI believed at that point\nwas going to be arrested before being transported to the hospital \nfor a jail clearance. Prior to \nbeing transported to the hospital, I believed he was under \narrest. That was what was relayed to me by\nand\n. At the \ntime all we had was the misdemeanor vandalism. I don’t remember telling \n that he was \nunder arrest. I don’t recall Officer Askew telling\n that he was under arrest.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 61 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

I do remember hearing Officer \nAskew say that\n could go to the hospital on a 5150 for being gravely disabled. I did not \nbelieve \nwas gravely disabled.  \n \nEven though there was a discussion around whether\nwas 5150, what was relayed to me \nby\nmade me believe \nwas under arrest. I did not speak with \n.  \n \nI don’t recall hearing Officer Askew say that\nagreed to come with us. This was a non-\nvoluntary transport because\n was placed under arrest for the vandalism. But I never told \nhim he was under arrest and I am not sure if Officer Askew ever said he was under arrest.  \n \nOfficer Askew transported \nto the hospital in the back of his patrol vehicle. In my opinion \nhe was under arrest at that time. I don’t recall if he was handcuffed during transport. I did \nrespond to the hospital with Officer Askew. We went to Scripps Mercy Hospital.  \n \nI didn’t directly respond to the hospital but remained on scene to conduct the investigation. I was \nassigned to be the case agent for this incident. I made the determination that I was the case agent. \nI did not speak with any witnesses, but I did walk the crime scene.  \n \nI was not present when Officer Askew arrived at the hospital with\n I was not present when \nOfficer Askew was checking in\nat the hospital. I arrived at the hospital after the \ninvestigation was complete at the scene. I would say I remained at the crime scene for another \nhalf hour, but I can’t be sure.  \n \nWhen I arrived at the hospital I don’t recall if \nwas still in handcuffs. I don’t remember \nremoving him from handcuffs. I do believe Officer Askew got into a 415 with hospital staff, but I \nwas not present for that. I became aware of the 415 after Officer Askew told me about it. He \nbasically got into an argument with the doctor because they were discussing his injuries. I don’t \nremember all the details of the argument, but it had something to do with the doctor who was \ntreating\n  \n \nI was not present when Officer Askew made demands that he needed an examination room. I was \nnot present when Officer Askew made demands that the patient needed X-Rays or CT scans. I \ndon’t recall a nurse asking me if the patient was under arrest. I don’t recall a nurse asking me if \nthe patient was on a 5150. I don’t recall telling anyone that \nwas not on a 5150. He was \nnot on a 5150, so I don’t recall telling anyone that. I don’t recall telling any of the hospital staff \nthat \nwas not under arrest, specifically. It’s possible that conversation did happen, but he \nwas under arrest. We were waiting to see what his treatment was going to be like and what they \nwere going to do with his injuries.   \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 62 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nI was not present when Officer Askew had the confrontation with the doctor. Officer Askew did \nmention that the doctor had planned to release the patient if Officer Askew placed him on a 5150. \nThat conversation may have taken place if Officer Askew was not informed on all the details of the \ncase.  \n \nI never saw Officer Askew acting discourteous towards hospital staff. He appeared frustrated and \nupset with the process at the hospital. I was not frustrated or upset with the process at the \nhospital.  \n \nProbable cause was developed to arrest\nbased on a picture obtained from a witness \nwhere\nwas holding a golf club near the victim’s car on the street. There were reports \nfrom witnesses that he was smashing the car. I did not speak with the victim. I believe either \nor another officer took their statements. If they had spoken to the victim, that would \nhave been relayed to me since I was the case agent. The victim was not at the scene. And no \nofficer spoke with the victim. The officers spoke to witnesses only, but no one spoke to a victim for \nthe vandalism, no. \n \nThe victim was identified because I ran a record check of the vehicle that was damaged and there \nwas a release of liability to an\n The address on the release of liability was not \nat the Pershing address, but I conducted a record check on\nand located a related address \nat 3800 Pershing, which was where the car was parked. And \nidentified his roommate \nor the person he was in a confrontation with as\n which I believe was\n  \n \nI did not watch the video from the dashcam that showed the vandalism. There was never a \ncurbside lineup done. To my knowledge, this crime did not occur in the presence of another \nofficer.  \n \nFor misdemeanor vandalism it depends on whether it is a cite-able offense. You can book someone \ninto jail for a misdemeanor vandalism. You can book someone into jail if the offense is likely to \ncontinue. I believed in this case the offense was likely to continue. I believed that because if he \nwere to be released at the scene, he could continue vandalizing the victim’s car because the victim \nwasn’t there to either stop him or report it to the police. I never admonished\n. I never \nobtained a statement from\n. He was uncooperative.   \n \nI am familiar with Department Procedure 4.01 dealing with stops, detentions, and pat downs. I \nhave received training on arrests and detentions. I received training at the academy and then \nthrough field training.  \n \nI do not know how\n received his head injury. I never spoke to him or got his statement \nbecause I believed Officer Askew had already talked to him and gotten that information from him. \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 63 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nHe was already uncooperative with Officer Askew. And I don’t recall ever hearing that\nwas a victim of 245.  \n \nI arrived late to the scene and I was merely a case agent assigned to take over. I wasn’t there \nwhen the officers arrived on scene and initially took custody of everyone and began taking \nstatements. I was merely there to be the case agent after everything went Code-4. I didn’t speak to \nany witnesses or victims. I was just documenting what other officers were telling me, and what \nthey believed happened. I was getting guidance on how the case was going to be documented. \nwas the one giving me that guidance. She was the one telling me that we were going \nto do an investigation for 594. I believe we couldn’t substantiate 245 because we didn’t have the \nother half that had been involved in the altercation. We were unable to determine what type of \ncrime had occurred between them that resulted in those injuries.  \n \nI was at the hospital with\nfrom maybe 45 minutes. The decision to write a notify \nwarrant for 594 was determined by \n and \n. I only spoke with \n  \n \nI believe Officer Askew was one of the first officers on scene. I don’t know who detained \n. I do not know why Officer Askew did not prepare a report. As the case agent I did not \nask Officer Askew to complete a report.  \n \nI have a body worn camera assigned to me and I have received training on how to use it. I am \nfamiliar with Department Procedure 1.49 as it relates to our BWC procedure. I did not activate \nmy camera at any point during this incident. I know I am required to activate my camera while \ndriving to a radio call that has the potential for enforcement action. In this case, I didn’t activate \nmy camera because I arrived late to the scene and it had gone Code-4 with\n already \ndetained. At that point I believed I was merely an investigative function instead of an enforcement \nfunction.  \n \nWhen I arrived on scene,\n was already in the back of a patrol vehicle and the door was \nopen. Officer Askew was having a conversation with \nand I would say there was a back \nand forth between Officer Askew and \n regarding\nnot wanting to be transported. I \ndid not feel the need to turn on the BWC at that point because they were discussing medical stuff.  \n \nBefore I arrived on scene, they were Code-4/SIC. I believed all future enforcement was done at \nthat point and I was just there to investigate the scene or fill in where needed. I didn’t believe I \nwould be doing any enforcement for anything at that point. And the only interaction I had with the \nsuspect was when Officer Askew was going back and forth at the patrol vehicle and at the hospital \nwhere I can’t have my camera on anyways.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 64 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

I was just doing the investigative portion of this \nincident. Then I received further direction from \non how to document the \ninvestigation.  \n \nAt the scene, no one knew whether the vandalism was a felony or a misdemeanor because we did \nnot know the value of the car. We didn’t determine the value until later in the investigation. The \nonly damage to the car was just the taillights.

Sanchez #5560 and I interviewed Officer Mark Askew \n#6986 in the Internal Affairs interview room. I read Officer Askew the Sworn Personnel Admonishment \nform containing the Lybarger and Garrity Warning. Officer Askew and I both signed the admonishment \nform and it was uploaded into IA Pro. Officer Askew elected to not have POA representative present \nduring his interview. The following is an “in essence” synopses of the interview.  (For exact and complete \ndetails of the interview, refer to the audio recording.) \n \nI am currently assigned to the Mid-City Division front counter, working 1st watch. I have been a \npolice officer for almost 12 years. I reviewed my BWC from this incident and I reviewed the crime \nreport for the call and there was an associated officer’s report. I believe it was\nreport.  \n \nI was working on June 22, 2023 and I was working extension of shift overtime to backfill patrol. I \nwas filling in for second watch. I was working as a single officer unit. I responded to a radio call \nat Pershing Avenue and University Avenue around 1848 hours. It was a 415-violent, I think it \ncame in as an active fight with a golf club.  \n \nWhen I arrived on scene,\nwas attempting to detain a male who was bleeding from \nhis head and his arm. I assisted in handcuffing the male. His shoulder had a huge gash it was \nprobably like an 8x5 and then he had about 5 contusions to his head. He told me he was unsure \nhow he received his injuries.  \n \nI eventually had the male take a seat in the back of my patrol vehicle, while we were waiting on \nmedics. He was detained because he matched the original description of the radio call. He \nverbally identified himself as \n. I don’t know if the officer conducting the \ninvestigation identified him or not. He gave me a back and forth statement, and it was really hard \nto get a statement from him. I am assuming that he probably got knocked out from either a golf \nclub or a weapon. So, he was all over the place with his statements. He did mention that he had \nbeen in an altercation with his roommate. The roommate was not present.  \n \nMedics eventually came to evaluate\nfor his injuries. We had not established a crime at \nthat point. We were still investigating. I told \nthat I believed \nwas a victim \nfor 245. I told him based on the injuries that it appeared to be a 245, yes.\nstated he was \nunsure what he got hit by. I kept asking him if his roommate had taken the golf club that he had \nbeen holding and then hit him over the head with it and he said he was unsure. I don’t remember if \nhe told me that he got hit. He may have said that later to\n but I am not sure if he \nsaid that to me.    \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 66 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nWe were unsure if \nwas a suspect in a 242. The call said that he had hit a car with a golf \nclub, so we at least had 594 there. And if he had initiated with the golf club it was 242/245 with \nhim as the suspect half. So, he was a possible suspect in a 242/245 and a possible victim in a 245. \nThere was no victim present. The roommate or other party wasn’t there. And they were trying to \nfigure out who the reporting party was and then identify other witnesses at the scene. \nwas not under arrest at this point. He was just detained, yes.   \n \nMedics arrived and treated him. They wrapped up his arm with gauze and bandages then did the \nsame thing to his head. I believe I asked\n if he had lost consciousness and I think he \nsaid he wasn’t sure.\n was telling me that he was refusing to go in the ambulance. He was \nsaying that he had a recent trip where he was transported, and he didn’t have money to pay \nmedical bills. He was refusing to go with medics. I believe \ndid say that he would take an \nUber, but due to his possible injuries he needed to be transported. I believe he may have said that \nI couldn’t force him into an ambulance and that he knew his rights. I encouraged him to go in the \nambulance for preservation of life. We were unsure of the injuries, the radio call stated he had a \ngolf club, he stated he was unsure what he got hit with, so he probably got knocked out. He had 4 \nor 5 contusions to his head along with that huge gash/laceration to his shoulder.  \n \nI told him that if he refused to go in the ambulance, I would be taking him to the hospital to get X-\nRays. Yes, I figured at that point we were still investigating whether he was just possibly only a \nvictim or if he was also a suspect. But I assumed he would be gravely disabled, unable to make \ndecisions for himself, for his safety and wellbeing. At this point he is not under arrest and he is \nstill detained.  \n \nI think\nmay have asked if he could take an Uber. He was still detained, and we were still \ninvestigating it and so he wasn’t free to leave. I don’t remember telling him no. I believe he was \nstill detained, and I told him that he was still detained. I probably said no because he was \ndetained, yes.  \n \nI told \nthat due to his head injury we had to take him to the hospital. I told him that \nbecause he suffered multiple contusions, possibly got knocked unconscious, he could have internal \nbleeding, a fractured skull, or could die.  \n \nI advised \nthat he was refusing to go with medics. Medics said they would go ahead \nand give him the okay to go with me and they would follow me.  \n \nI believe at that point we were still investigating, and I advised \nabout the vehicle \nthat had been hit and that there was broken glass on the ground. We knew we had a 594 based on \nthe reporting party, that he \n matched the suspect. Correct I believed,\nwas a \nvictim for 245 based on the injuries that he had sustained. Yes,\nand I had a \ndiscussion and we concluded that\nwas a victim of 245 based on the injuries, correct.   \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 67 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nOther officers, I don’t know how many other officers were there, but they were determining \nwhether he was also a suspect. I never talked to the reporting party, so I was still unsure if he was \nour suspect for the 594 and if he had initiated a 242/245. So, I was still in the dark on that. \n \nWhen\n and I had our discussion I believe that we also came to the conclusion that \nwas also a suspect in the 594 because we were standing right next to that vehicle, where \nmy patrol car was parked, with the busted taillight. I believe the vandalism was just a \nmisdemeanor because it was just a taillight. I didn’t expect the rest of the vehicle but that was the \nonly damage I saw once I arrived on scene and detained him.   \n \nNo one was coming forward as the victim for the vandalism. They were trying to find the witness \nand reporting party for the fight or whatever happened to\n There was not a victim present \nstating they wanted to press charges for a misdemeanor vandalism, at least not right then, no. I \ndon’t know if one came forward later, I was at the hospital.  \n \n was the case agent. That was determined because I was working extension of shift \nand I believe it was around 1900 at that time and he would have been working up until 2200 or \n2400.    \n \nI don’t remember \n ever asking if he wanted to take him out of handcuffs. I don’t \nremember that ever taking place. I remember telling him that we still thought he was the suspect \nfor potentially a 594 or for 242/245. If that was on video of \nasking if we wanted to \ntake him out of handcuffs, then that was on video. I don’t recall that.  \n \nI told \n that he either had to go in the ambulance or he would have to go with me to the \nhospital, correct. Due to his injuries yes. I believe medics stated that they were okay with \n \nnot going in an ambulance, which to myself sounded strange, due to his injuries. Yes, I thought it \nwas strange. It could have been life sustaining injuries. I have seen somebody just fall, hit their \nhead, and die. He got hit in the head, sustained multiple contusions, and a golf club was probably \ninvolved. Then he had that huge gash to his shoulder. \n \nsaid he would rather go with me rather than go to the hospital in an ambulance. He said \nhe didn’t want to pay for the ambulance ride. Yes, he was still lawfully detained at this point and \nwe were still investigating whether he was the suspect for the initial part of the call. He was not \nunder arrest at this point, he was still detained.    \n \nI believe it was not just\n expressing concern for transporting the patient in the \nback of a patrol vehicle, but it was also myself and \n. And I believe that is why the \nambulance agreed to follow. I think we all had concern over transporting\nbecause of his \ninjuries and he wasn’t wanting to go with medics. That is why medics decided to follow us.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 68 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nIt was probably brought up by \n that there was a liability in transporting\n, \nyes. My thoughts on that were, again I would prefer him to go with medics. But if medics are \nclearing him, the Sergeant on scene is saying this is good to go and that he can go with me, and \nmedics are following, then I feel like we are fine. I would still have preferred him going in the \nambulance though. The medics stated they were good with it and they were going to sign off on it \nand let him go with me, which again I thought was strange. But he needed to be seen at the \nhospital to determine the extent of his injuries. I remember \nsaying she was good \nwith him going with me, I remember discussing that he didn’t want to go in the ambulance, and he \nwas going with me, and she was good to go with that. I don’t recall when \nstated that \nwe had to take the male or that it would be a liability to not transport him. When that occurred, it \nwas probably in that couple minute conversation where we were trying to figure out what to do. \nAnd if we left him there it would have been a liability on us and on medics for not taking him to \nthe hospital to determine those injuries because he could possibly die.  \n \nI don’t recall \nasking if \nwas on a 5150. I know that I discussed probably \nwith \nand \n, that if he was refusing to go and he is only a victim in the \nend, that he would place him on a 5150. If he was refusing treatment for his injuries, then he was \ngravely disabled. I thought he was gravely disabled because if he was unable to care for himself. \nHe didn’t want to get an MRI, CT scan, or X-Rays of his head, he could have had internal \nbleeding and he could’ve died. Our main concern is preservation of life, so if he is unable to care \nfor himself to make that decision, he possibly got knocked out, and he is not thinking straight. \nPeople can say things all the time when they are involved in altercations. They get hit with objects \nand they can say they didn’t get knocked out when they in fact did. He got hit 4 or 5 times and had \ncontusions to his head, so I didn’t really believe that he did or didn’t get knocked out, but it was a \npossibility. He probably said he didn’t lose consciousness or possibly said it, I don’t recall.  \n \nI believe he had been drinking and had consumed 2-3 drinks, but he was not 647(f) or anything, \nno. Other than his injury, he wasn’t forth right with his story, but there was nothing else in his \nbehavior that led me to believe he was gravely disabled. But again, due to his injuries he needed \nto be transported. I have never received medical training, but I have been on the job for 12 years. \ndid AMA with medics, he signed with medics.  \n \nI transported \nto Scripps Mercy hospital. Medics did follow me to the hospital. They \nfollowed me to the hospital in case he passed out while we were enroute to the hospital.  Well due \nto a head injury normally he would be transported by medics but since he was refusing, and due to \nthe head injury medics felt concerned and that is why they decided to follow.  \n \nHe was not detained on a 5150 during transport, he was detained as a suspect from the crime \nscene because we were still determining that. \n \nOfficer Askew was asked if we are allowed to move subjects detained for a crime. \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 69 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \n \nSo, for his health and safety, if it wasn’t determined that it was a crime and he was just detained \npending that investigation, then I guess at that point he was detained for 5150. It was still pending \nso. I don’t recall at that point if I told him he was detained for 5150, but I told him that he could \nbe if he was only the victim of the crime.  \n \nHe was not under arrest during the transport, no. It had not been determined yet. Correct, I \ntransported him believing this was a voluntary transport. I transported him believing he was the \nsuspect for the crime, that it was still being investigated, and he was also a victim. He agreed to \ngo to the hospital with me yes. Yes, he was handcuffed.  \n \nHe did not have an option to go in an Uber. Again, he was still a suspect in the crime, and it was \nstill being investigated. He agreed to go to the hospital with me. He was still detained pending the \ninvestigation. He was a possible suspect and we believed him to be a victim. He was detained at \nthat point. He was not free to leave, he was detained.  \n \narrived and met me at the hospital maybe 20-30 minutes later. When we arrived \nat the hospital\nwas handcuffed. Yes, I walked \n to the front desk. I advised them \nthat we needed MRIs and CT scans urgently. Medics were not with me when I walked\n up \nto get checked in. Medics peeled off when I arrived at the hospital.  \n \nWhen I got to the hospital I said, “We have a major trauma, we need X-Rays and MRIs.” The \nnurse behind the desk said I needed to check him in first and I said, “Okay, I’ll go ahead and do \nthat.” I checked him in, I asked if we had a room, I checked him in. And they said, “You need to \ncall the charge nurse.” And I said, “Okay, I’ll go ahead and do that, I figure you would have \ngotten the charge nurse here based on the injuries I told you.”  \n \nWhen you walk into the ER, you have the nurse’s station, there is a side room for intake, where \nyou check their name, date of birth, social, and you get them a wrist band. Then following that, \nyou would call the charge nurse to say I am here for a 5150 or whatever the case may be. But \nwhen I came in I said, “We have a major trauma, he didn’t want to go with medics, he got hit in \nthe head probably with a golf club multiple times, and his shoulder is lacerated.” After I checked \nhim in a nurse told me I needed to call the charge nurse. I said, “Okay, I will go ahead and do \nthat if you didn’t do it.” I followed the nurse’s instructions at that point. That nurse was very rude, \nsame thing with the doctor that later followed, so yes, I did get in an argument with them.  \n \nThe nurse and I got into an argument once she finally heard the injuries she said, “This is a major \ntrauma.” That’s when I told her, “I know that’s what I said when I walked in. He refused medics, \nhe needs X-ray, MRI, and he probably got hit in the head with a golf club because that was \nmentioned. But he is not saying anything. He has 4-5 contusions and a laceration to his shoulder.” \nShe at that point received the extent of the injuries and then we had a room.  \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 70 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nI told them that it was a major trauma and he needed CT scans, X-rays, and MRIs and I described \nthe injuries. The nursing staff never told me that was a decision for the doctor. I didn’t put any \nfurther pressure on medical staff outside of what I already described.  \n \nOnce we got to the room, I don’t remember if it was a nurse or a doctor, but I was asked if \nwas on a hold. I told them that it was pending an investigation of whether he is under \narrest at this point.  \n \nThe doctor eventually came in and asked\nwhat had happened, and\ndidn’t really \ndescribe it. I described the call, the injuries to his head and the golf club that might have been \nused. The doctor then told me that if the patient didn’t want treatment that we are not going to \ntreat him. That’s when I told him that he was detained pending investigation, but if he was only a \nvictim, then due to his injuries, he would be placed on a 5150 for being gravely disabled. I said he \nneeds these treatments to make sure that he isn’t going to die. The doctor then said, “if you put \nhim on a 5150 hold, we will then let him walk out when you leave.” And I said, “Well that liability \nwill be on you if this guy dies.” And I called the sergeant immediately after that.  \n \nI removed handcuffs from \nwhen he was in his bed and when the doctor said, “This is a \nHIPPA violation you need to step out of the room,” which I haven’t encountered before. I wasn’t \nargumentative with hospital staff.  \n \nI was definitely not discourteous towards hospital staff. I was frustrated when I told them about \nthe injuries and that he needed X-rays, CT, and MRIs because they just nonchalantly brushed me \noff and told me to check him in. Then when I checked him in and asked for a room, they said I \nneeded to call the charge nurse, I was surprised they hadn’t called the charge nurse themselves \nalready due to the injuries. They called the charge nurse and I stood by.    \n \nThen I was frustrated with the doctor when I explained to the doctor that we were pending an \ninvestigation and we were unsure if he was under arrest or not. Then the doctor said, “well if he is \nnot under arrest and he doesn’t want treatment then we are going to let him go.” Then I told him \nthat if he was a victim then we would place him on a 5150 so he could get treatment. That is when \nthe doctor told me he would let him go as soon as I left and that is when I told the doctor the \nliability was on him. So, I was definitely frustrated with the first nurse and the doctor. But I was \ndefinitely not argumentative with them. \n \nAt no point did the medical staff tell me that they would treat \nand I was free to leave. I \nwas probably at the hospital for 30-35 minutes. I was not at the hospital when \nwas placed \nunder arrest. After calling \nand informing her about the issue with the doctor, I was \nrelieved by\n and I left.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 71 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nI informed \n that the hospital staff did not want to treat\n and told her that I \nhad been asked to step out of the room due to the HIPPA violation and I had complied. And I let \nher know the doctor was rude. And no at this point, I am thinking that I probably should have filed \na complaint against that doctor.  \n \nWell based on everything going on now I want to. I called \nand briefed her and that \nis the worst experience I have ever had at a hospital. I talked to my brother that was a nurse at \nUCSD and a friend who works UCSD and they couldn’t believe what happened.  \n \nI do not know how probable cause was developed to arrest\n  \n \nI am familiar with department procedure 4.01 regarding stop, detentions, and pat down. I have \nreceived training on arrests and detentions. Training at the academy and then at AOT every two \nyears. We can detain someone for as long a it’s reasonable, after 20-30 minutes its likely an \narrest. I believe we were on scene for 10 minutes before transport, so it was still a detention. A \ndetention can quickly become an arrest if you determine evidence for an arrest. An example would \nbe a witness identify a suspect.  \n \nI am aware that detention + transport = arrest, yes. At that point when we moved him, I believed \nit was still pending, it was still a detention, and that it was on that gray area for a 5150 detention \nas well. That’s what I felt in my eyes, and that is what the sergeant felt as well. I didn’t place a \nhold on him, it was still being investigated. Obviously, they ultimately placed him under arrest, so \nhe wasn’t placed on a hold. But I did not place him on a hold no.  \n \nI don’t believe I ever told the patient that if he attempted to walk away that I would place him on a \n5150. I only told the doctors that he was detained pending an investigation, but that if he was only \na victim that he would be put on a 5150. I don’t believe the subject of interest would have walked \naway while I was standing there with him.  \n \nI believe we can force someone to get medical treatment if they are gravely disabled and under \nthose circumstances. The gravely disabled portion was his injuries but specifically his injuries \ncould have likely caused him to die, after being hit in the head with a golf club possibly and \nsuffering 4-5 contusions. Being hit in the head one time in the head with a golf club could kill \nsomebody.  \n \nAfter trained medical professionals evaluated \n and advised they could not force treatment \nI thought it was a liability on them for not transporting and I thought that was strange. I thought it \nwas a liability on them for not transporting and allowing him to sign, due to the injuries. And then \nit would have been a liability on the hospital for not treating him for those injuries.  \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 72 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nOfficer Askew was asked why he wouldn’t let the liability rest with medical professionals.  \n \nBecause preservation of life, I feel that if they make a wrong decision, for what I feel is wrong, \nand he needs treatment, then I am going to take him to the hospital to get treated.  \n \nI can’t say\nwas acting in a way that would cause him to die right then and there. Again, I \nam not a medical professional. I don’t know. I have seen people die seconds after being hit in the \nhead or die 30 minutes later or a couple hours later after being hit in the head.  \n \nOfficer Askew was asked: EMS medical professionals evaluated\nand told you that they couldn’t \nforce\n to get treatment. Then a trained medical doctor evaluated\nand said he couldn’t \nforce treatment on\n. But you thought they were wrong, and you could force treatment on \n? \n \n \nSo, based on gravely disabled, yes.  \n \n \nThe decision to prepare a notify warrant I assume would have been made by\n \n or\n.  \n \nI called\n and I think he still wanted to keep\n there with the subject. I \ndon’t think he gave me any instructions, but he told me he would contact\n.  \n \nI did not prepare a police report because I was not the arresting officer and I felt \nhad the initial detainment of\ncovered. I guess I spoke with\nthe longest. It was \ndifficult to get a statement, it was back and forth, so. My BWC was on when those statements were \nobtained. I passed the information on to\n. I believe I told \n that I \nbelieved \nwas a victim of 245.  \n \nThe interview concluded at 0925 hours.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 73 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Thim #5560 and I interviewed \n \n in the Internal Affairs interview room. I read\n the Sworn Personnel Admonishment \nform containing the Lybarger and Garrity Warning.\n and I both signed the admonishment \nform and it was uploaded into IA Pro.\n. The following is an “in essence” synopses of the interview.  (For exact and complete details of the \ninterview, refer to the audio recording.) \n \nI am a patrol sergeant at Mid-City Division, and I am working first watch. I have been with the \npolice department for about 13 years. I reviewed my BWC from this incident and read reports \nfrom this incident. I watched the BWC from Officer Askew’s video with you and it helped refresh \nmy recollection of the events that took place on that date.  \n \nI was working on June 22, 2023, and I was a patrol sergeant working 2nd watch. I responded to a \nradio call at Pershing and University Avenue around 1840 hours. The radio call was of a male \nwielding a golf club and swinging it at cars and a person. I believe this was a priority one call. \nInitially the call stated the male was swinging the golf club at a car and then it progressed to him \nswinging the club at a person. I was the supervisor in charge for this call.  \n \nWhen I arrived on scene, I saw a male who was bleeding from his head and his body. He was \nstanding on the sidewalk near the street, he was shirtless, and he had pants on. I detained him and \nI believe he was later identified as\n yes. At the time the radio call stated that the \nreporting party described the suspect with the golf club as a male who was bleeding in the street. \nSo, I detained him as the male who was swinging a golf club at a car and a person.  Officer Askew \nplaced the male in handcuffs.  \n \nThe male appeared to have several lacerations to his head, face, arm, and maybe back. He was \nbleeding profusely. The male did not tell me how he received his injuries.  \n \nAfter he was detained, I walked to the place which he identified as his residence. He had made a \ncomment that he had been in a disturbance with his roommate. So, I went to the residence to see if \nthe roommate was still there. The roommate was not there when I checked the residence.  \n \nWhile there, I stood by and waited for officers to clear the residence. While I was standing by, one \nof the neighbors flagged me down and said he had witnessed some of the incident. So, I obtained \nhis statement.  \n \nWhile at the location I observed property damage to the property. The fence was significantly \ndamaged; the unit had damage to the front screen door, I believe and the front window, at least. \nAfter clearing the residence, I went back to where Officer Askew was.  \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 74 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nWhen I went back to where Officer Askew was, medics were evaluating\n injuries. I \nhad established a general crime in terms of what the witness had said and the state of\ninjuries. Some sort of assault had occurred, and it had been between\nand his roommate. \nThe witnesses had said that the two had been fighting with one another and that they both had \nobjects in their hands. So, I believed both males had been involved in an assault with a deadly \nweapon with one another. The other crime was potentially a vandalism.\n was not \nunder arrest at that point. He was detained pending further. \n \nOfficer Askew did brief me on this incident regarding what\n had told him. He said that \nhad identified himself as the victim. Officer Askew told me that he believed \n was \na victim of 245, yes. When Officer Askew briefed me, I was not under the impression that\ndid not want to go to the hospital. He said that\ndid not want to go to the hospital in an \nambulance due to the cost of the ambulance.  \n \nOfficer Askew’s BWC video was shown in the interview room at time stamp 18:20.   \n \nOfficer Askew did tell\nthat if he refused to go in the ambulance he would be going to the \nhospital, yes. Those were the two options that were provided to him. My understanding was that \nwanted to go to the hospital, but he didn’t want to pay for an ambulance. And so those \nwere the two options that were given. You can either go to the hospital in the ambulance or in a \npatrol car.\nwas still detained at the point, yes.  \n \nI heard him say something to the effect that he didn’t want to go to the hospital because he \ncouldn’t afford the bill, but it was relative to the ambulance cost. I don’t recall\n \nrequesting to go to the hospital in an Uber. I don’t recall Officer Askew ever mentioning an Uber.  \n \nI determined \n was a victim of 245, yes. I determined he was a suspect in a crime as \nwell. He was a suspect in a 245 and a vandalism.\n was determined to be the case \nagent. Officer Askew was working overtime and so \nvolunteered to be the case \nagent because it was his service area.   \n \nOfficer Askew’s BWC video was shown in the interview room at time stamp 20:18.   \n \nYes, I heard\n ask, “Do we want to get him out of handcuffs?” Yes, I heard Officer \nAskew say, “You are either going to go in the ambulance or you are coming with us.” Yes, I heard \nOfficer Askew tell \nthat he has to go to the hospital. Yes, I heard\n refuse to go \nin the ambulance because he could not afford it. Yes, I heard the medics say they could not force \nto get transported or treated for his injuries. Yes, I heard\n tell Officer Askew that \nhe would rather go in the back of a patrol vehicle over going in an ambulance.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 75 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nwas still lawfully detained at this point. At the time we didn’t know the outcome of \nthe investigation, because it was still in process, and still an ongoing investigation.  \n \n did express concern over transporting\n, yes. He was concerned with an \nin-custody death in the car. Yes, when he said that it made me pause or have concern over\n concerns. My thought process was, he was not free to go, I was concerned over the \nextent of his injuries, and I figured if there was any risk of him dying on the way to the hospital \nbetween our location and Scripps Mercy then there would be a risk of him dying while he was \ndetained on the street where we were. So, in my head, it was better for us to be transporting him to \nthe hospital for his injuries than just having him on the street, knowing that those injuries were \nstill pending evaluation.  \n \nOfficer Askew’s BWC video was shown in the interview room at time stamp 20:38.   \n \nYes, I heard that. I said, “We can’t afford not to. We have to.” I said that because I was concerned \nover the severity of his injuries, particularly the injuries to his head. There was some discussion \nabout whether or not he was on a 5150. I think that discussion happened because they were trying \nto work through transporting him to the hospital while he was detained. Officer Askew did \nmention that\ncould be on a 5150 for being gravely disabled. I remember entertaining that \nquestion, but Officer Askew clarified that\nwanted to go. Or I clarified with\n if he \nwanted to go. One of us clarified that he wanted to go, so it wasn’t up for discussion.  \n \ndid eventually AMA with medics, yes. He was transported by the hospital, yes. He \nwas transported to Scripps Mercy. I gave Officer Askew the authority to transport\n, yes. \nHe was not detained for 5150. He was not under arrest, he was detained upon being transported, \npending investigation. I don’t know if he was handcuffed when he was transported.  \n \nI believed \nwas freely, voluntarily, and willfully going to the hospital with Officer Askew, \nyes. His other option would have been to stay on scene. Ultimately, he had the option to stay on \nscene, yes. But my understanding was that he wanted to go to the hospital. He was not free to \nleave. I believe he wanted to go to the hospital, he just didn’t want to pay for an ambulance.  \n \n was asked: Based on\n being detained and us wanting to evaluate\n for his \ninjuries … If\n wanted to remain on scene would we still have transported him at that point? \n \nNo? .... The only reason we transported him is because he said he wanted to go to the hospital. I \nremember him specifically saying, “I want to go to the hospital. I just don’t want to pay for an \nambulance.”  Yes, some of things I am basing my decisions on are based on what Officer Askew is \ntelling me. I am not privy to everything being said.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 76 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nThere was a moment when we were all standing there where I remember hearing him say \nsomething to the effect of, “I want to go the hospital, I just don’t want to pay for an ambulance.” \nYes, I was aware that Officer Askew had given\nonly two options: going with us or going \nin the ambulance. But my understanding was that he wanted to go to the hospital.  Yes, I heard \nhim say, “you are either going in the ambulance or you are coming with us”. Those were the two \ntransport options, yes. I don’t believe\nagreed to go to the hospital under duress despite \nbeing handcuffed and being given only two options. Those were the two transport \noptions.  \n \nI did give directions to officers on how to handle the 594 portions of this incident. I spoke with \n, after speaking with the\n advised how he wanted to the paperwork to be formatted and documented and so I \npassed that on to\n. I told \n to complete a 594 notify warrant. That \nwas what the \n indicated. The\n was \n.  \n \nYes, I did give directions to officers on how to handle the 245-portion of this incident. My \ninstructions were to document that in the narrative of the report.\n stated he wanted \nto format the report that way. I told\n that our suspect was also a victim of 245.  \n \nProbable cause was established when I spoke to two witnesses after\nwas transported to \nthe hospital. One of the witnesses had photos that show\nnear the vehicle that was \ndamaged. Then he also indicated he had video of \ndamaging the vehicle. He sent me the \nphotos; he was not able to send me the video at that time. But he stated that the male in the photos \nwas the one who damaged the vehicle. When I looked at the photos, I recognized the male in the \nphotos as \n.  \n \nNo, a victim was never located. There was nobody present to state they wanted \n \nplaced under arrest for that crime. A curbside lineup was never done, no. This crime did not occur \nin the presence of another officer, no. \n \nI reviewed the reports from Officer Askew, \n, my own report, and um a fourth \nofficer I can’t recall who it was. He was an overtime officer as well.  \n \nI was aware that a request for a notify warrant was made which was written in the body of the \narrest report. The vandalism was a misdemeanor based on how it was written. I know why a 245-\ncrime case was never completed for this incident. It was not completed because we did not have \nthe other party as a victim with\n as the suspect. And based on what I had overheard from \n and Officer Askew,\n was largely uncooperative around the details of him \nbeing a victim of a 245. Yes, we also did not have a victim for the 594, correct.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 77 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nwas asked: Why did we decide to document a misdemeanor crime instead of a felony \ncrime? \n \n \n That was based on the damage they believed, the value of the broken taillights of the vehicle.  \n \nWhen\n was transported, I believed he was detained. I am familiar with Department \nProcedure 4.01 dealing with Stops, Detentions, and Pat downs, yes. I have received training on \narrests and detentions. I have been to an academy…um I have been to AOT. I am not sure what \nyou are asking. I received training through a POST certified academy, and I have been through \nphase training. I am aware that a detention can quickly become an arrest when there is a \ndetention plus movement.  \n \nIn my mind there were two things going on and I viewed them separately. He was detained and \nthen how\nwanted to go to the ambulance was two different things in my mind.  \n \n was at the hospital when I talked with\n.\n and I had several \nback and forth conversations about this incident because it was complicated. While he was at the \nhospital there was some discussion about whether \n was under arrest and ultimately, we \ndetermined that we would release him at the hospital and write the report.  \n \nBased on my 15-year experience I am aware that a suspect can also have injuries, yes. And \nappear to be a victim, yes. That day we never found the roommate. Based on the neighbor’s \nstatement, the roommate may have shown up at a hospital with injuries and \ncould \nhave been a suspect for 245, yes. I believe I would have been derelict in my duties to release\n \n before an investigation had been done, yes. If he would have been arrested for 245, he \nwould have been required to go to the hospital for a medical clearance based on the injuries I \nsaw.  \n \nYes, he did AMA from medics. Like I said I heard something to the effect of “He wanted medical \nattention.” He just didn’t want to go in an ambulance. Based on his injuries I was concerned. He \nhad significant injuries, a head injury, something to that effect. There was so much blood coming \nfrom his head, he had a very large laceration on his right arm. And the amount of blood all over \nhis body made it very difficult to know exactly where all the injuries were. When he said he wanted \nto go in the ambulance, I wanted to get him medical treatment. I was concerned that the injuries \nthat he had were of an unknown severity, but life threatening based on there were so many around \nhis head. And from my understanding he had been struck several times.  \n \nThe interview concluded at 1533 hours.  \n \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 78 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Upon arrival\n was already detaining a possible suspect\n. \nOfficer Askew walked over and handcuffed\n.\n had injuries to his head and right arm and \nstated that he had been assaulted by his roommate \n Officers requested medics to evaluate \n injuries.  \n \nDuring the detention, medics arrived to treat\nfor his injuries. Officers stated they believed \nwas a victim of 245(a)(1) PC (Assault with a Deadly Weapon). They also stated they were \nunsure if\n was a suspect of 245(a)(1) PC or 594 PC (vandalism) since the other roommate had \nfled the location.  \n \n ultimately refused to be transported to the hospital by ambulance. Officer Askew told\n \nthat he did not have a choice in receiving treatment.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nSDPD Department Procedure 4.01, IV, C: Stop/Detention and Pat Down Procedure, revised August \n27, 2021, states in part:  \n \nC. Detention \n \nA detention, also referred to as a “stop”, occurs when officers use their authority to compel a person to \nhalt, to remain in a certain place, or to perform some act, such as walking to a nearby location. Courts \nhave used the terminology “investigative stop” for a detention. A detention is allowed so an officer may \nhave a reasonable amount of time to investigate a person’s possible involvement in actual or perceived \ncriminal activity, allowing the officer to make an informed decision whether to arrest, or to release, the \nsubject. If the persons have been told they are not free to leave the officer’s presence, a detention has \noccurred. When conducting a detention, the officer shall notify the subject contacted that he or she is no \nlonger free to leave. However, officers are not required to make such a notification if it would hamper an \ninvestigation or jeopardize the officer’s safety \n \n1. If an officer reasonably suspects that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to \ncommit any crime, the authority to detain that person exists. Courts have used the terminology \n“Criminal activity is afoot” to describe these circumstances. The officer may exercise this \nauthority in any place that the officer has the right to be. Both pedestrians and persons in \nvehicles may be detained. A detention is warranted if there is a reasonable suspicion by the \nofficer that:  \n \na. Some activity relating to crime has taken place, is presently taking place, or is \nabout to occur; and,  \n \nb. The person to be stopped or detained is involved in that activity. \n \n4. Detention vs. Arrest  \n \na. If not handled properly, a “detention” could become an “arrest” which, if not   \nsupported by “probable cause” to arrest, would be illegal.  \n \nb. General Rule: The least intrusive means should be used during a detention. \n \nc. The following list contains some factors that could cause a detention to turn into an \narrest:  \n \n(1) Numerous officers involved;  \n \n(2) Display of weapons;  \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 80 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \n \n(3) Use of handcuffs;  \n \n(4) Person is placed in back of a patrol car;  \n \n(5) Encounter is in non-public setting;  \n \n(6) The officer’s authoritative manner and actions imply that compliance    \n      is compelled; and,  \n \n(7) The officer did not advise the detainee of his right to terminate the    \n      encounter.  \n \nNote: The use of handcuffs or weapons or placing someone in a patrol car do \nnot automatically make the contact an arrest if the actions are seen as \nreasonably necessary under the circumstances (person attempts to flee, officer \nsafety concerns) and the person is told that they are only being detained, as \nopposed to arrested. \n \n5. Proper justification for a detention does not permit unreasonable conduct during the  \ndetention. All police activity during a detention shall be done in a reasonable manner. The \ncourts, in determining whether the detention was reasonable and lawful, will consider every \nphase of a detention. \n \na. Duration of the Detention  \n \nA person stopped pursuant to this procedure may be detained for a reasonable amount \nof time under the circumstances. Officers should detain a person only for the length of \ntime necessary to determine if the person should be arrested or released.  \n \nb. Scope of the Detention  \n \nA reasonable on-the-scene investigation is all that is authorized by law during a \ndetention. Therefore, an officer shall not move a detainee unless:  \n \n(1) The officer obtains the detainee’s consent to be moved;  \n \n(2) The officer has probable cause to arrest the detainee;  \n \n(3) A victim cannot, for valid reasons, be brought to the scene of the  \n      detention;  \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 81 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \n \n(4) The movement is for a reasonable distance and facilitates the completion  \nof the investigation (i.e., securing the detainee in a patrol car while completing an \ninvestigation); or,  \n \n(5) The movement is for the safety of the officer or the detainee.  \n \nc. Explanation to a Detained Person  \n \nOfficers shall act with as much restraint and courtesy towards the detained person as is \npossible under the circumstances. Plainclothes officers making a detention shall \nidentify themselves as law enforcement officers as soon as it is appropriate. At some \npoint during the detention, the officer should give the detainee an explanation of the \npurpose of the stop, unless such an explanation would jeopardize officer safety or \nhamper an investigation.  \n \nf. Tactical Options  \n \nOfficers should strive to maintain a position of advantage (POA) and place the \nsubject(s) contacted at a disadvantage whenever possible. Three techniques are: \nplacing a subject on the curb, on the patrol vehicle’s push bumper, or in the back seat \nof a patrol vehicle. While officer safety is of primary concern, curb sitting was not \ndesigned to be a standard practice in all situations and officers recognize that \ncommunity members find this tactic disrespectful.  \n \nIf a situation justifies having a subject sit on the curb, the subject should be removed \nfrom that position once the threat has been mitigated (i.e., additional officers arrive on \nscene). This technique is only appropriate under circumstances where officer safety is \nthreatened.  \n \nCalifornia Penal Code 240 reads:  \n \nAn assault is an unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person \nof another. \n \nCalifornia Penal Code 245 reads in part:    \n \n(a)(1) Any person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or  \ninstrument other than a firearm shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for \ntwo, three, or four years, or in a county jail for not exceeding one year, or by a fine not \nexceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both the fine and imprisonment. \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 82 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

The 72-hour period begins at the time when the person is first detained.

Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nMy review of CAD shows the officers responded to the radio call and were given the description of \nas the suspect. Officers lawfully detained\n believing he was the suspect in a vandalism as \ndescribed on the radio call. However, once\nwas detained further information came to light \ncausing the officers to question whether\n was an actual victim and not a suspect. \nand\nboth obtained witness statements where they described\n as being assaulted \nby his roommate and witnesses stated they observed the roommate either with a weapon or saw the \nroommate striking\n with the weapon. The dominant aggressor was described as the roommate \nwho had fled the scene. Officer Askew later stated in his interview he believed\n was a victim of \n245 PC based on his injuries.   \n \nMy review of Officer Askew’s BWC shows\nproviding a statement to Officer Askew regarding \nthe details of what occurred.\ntold Officer Askew that he was attempting to gain access into his \nown apartment and his roommate\n was preventing him from gaining access by blocking the door. \ntold Officer Askew that\n came out of the apartment and they began fighting. While \n in not fully forthcoming in his statement, he does admit that\nroommate, had \nassaulted him.\n states multiple times that he does not recall whether\n had a weapon during \nthe assault. Officers later locate witnesses, however, who corroborate that the suspect did in fact have a \nweapon and then later tossed the weapon before fleeing the scene. It is unclear if the weapon used was in \nfact the golf club which was later recovered.\nadmitted to having the golf club in his possession at \nsome point. Officer Askew later tells\n that\n is uncooperative, yet there is enough \ninformation provided to Officer Askew to establish that\n was a victim of 245(a)(1) PC.    \n \nIn the video,\n makes the following statements:  \n \n• 03:40 – “I am not a suspect bro. I am a victim.” \n \n• 04:27 – “I feel like a fucking criminal.”  \n \n• 06:26 – “Can I stand outside? I am not under arrest. I am not under arrest though, right?”  \n \n• 14:04 – “I feel like I am getting the worst end of the stick and I am the victim. I am just being real \nwith you though.

Officer Askew tells\nhe will not be allowed to go to the hospital in \nan Uber, with a family member, or with a friend.\nfinally agrees to go to the hospital with Officer \nAskew, but the agreement is made through coercion. Furthermore, Officer Askew makes up his mind to \ntransport\n to the hospital whether he chose to go or not. This is revealed through the discussion \nover whether\nwill be placed on a 5150 W&I for gravely disabled.  \n \nAfter\n signs the medical waiver with medics that he is refusing medical transport, Officer Askew \ntransports\nto the hospital handcuffed. Officer Askew states in his interview\n was still \ndetained at this point and was not under arrest.   \n \nUpon arriving at the hospital multiple nurses ask Officer Askew whether\n is under arrest or \ndetained per 5150 W&I. Officer Askew states that\nis not under arrest or on a 5150 W&I. \nMultiple nurses hear Officer Askew threatening to place \non a 5150 W&I if \n attempts to \nwalk away.

Officer Askew stated in his interview he felt it was a liability for hospital staff to \ngive\n the option for treatment while at the hospital. Officer Askew stated he felt that per 5150 \nW&I (Gravely Disabled) it allowed him to override the opinions of highly trained medical professionals \nand that his transport\ncame out of a concern for\n injuries.

Using a combination of tactics to include being placed in handcuffs, being placed in the \nback of a patrol vehicle, being transported away from the scene, as well as\n statements of saying \nhe felt like he was being treated like a criminal quickly elevated this detention into an arrest.

Officer Askew told\nthat he did not have a choice in receiving treatment. Officer Askew told\nhe would either be going \nto the hospital by ambulance or in the back of a patrol vehicle.\n signed an AMA waiver (Against \nMedical Advice) and refused medical transport by ambulance. Medics advised the officers that\n \nhad the right to refuse transport. Officer Askew transported \n to the hospital handcuffed.  \n \nUpon arriving at the hospital, multiple nurses and staff members stated Officer Askew was demanding \n be placed in an examination room.

Many nurses stated Officer Askew made them feel uncomfortable, and \nfelt he was overbearing and aggressive in how he interacted with the staff. Officer Askew was again \ndescribed as being argumentative and asking questions or making demands that were inappropriate and \noutside of his field of expertise.  \n \n stated in his interview he was aware that Officer Askew was involved in an argument \nwith hospital staff. He stated he was not present for the argument but that Officer Askew had informed \nhim of the disagreement with the\n.\nstated Officer Askew appeared frustrated \nand upset with the hospital process.  \n \nOfficer Askew stated in his interview he was involved in an argument with the charge nurse and the \ndoctor. He stated he was not discourteous, but that he was frustrated with the process. He acknowledged \nthat he had been asked to step out of the examination room by the doctor due to HIPPA and he felt the \ndoctor was rude. Officer Askew said in his interview he had wished he had filed a complaint against the \nhospital because he felt they provided the worst service he had ever experienced.  \n \nWhile there was no video evidence available showing Officer Askew’s interactions with hospital staff, \nmultiple hospital staff members came forward to state they had observed Officer Askew’s behavior and \nfound him to be rude, discourteous, and argumentative. Officer Askew acknowledged in his interview he \nhad been involved in two arguments with hospital staff.  \n \nOfficer Askew was repeatedly discourteous towards hospital staff and made demands on the patients’ \nmedical treatment and evaluation which was highly inappropriate given Officer Askew’s training, \nexperience, and job classification. His behavior was deemed to be not only discourteous but disruptive \nand a distraction to the overall operations of the hospital which affected numerous employees. Officer \nAskew’s behavior and actions reflected poorly on the San Diego Police Department and is not reflective \nof the behavior expected from our officers. In addition, Officer Askew showed a lack of understanding of \nlaws by falsely arresting\nand then by continued to threaten to place\n on a 5150 W&I hold \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 95 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT.

POLICY – SUSTAINED \n \nOfficer Askew’s performance during this criminal investigation was unsatisfactory and did not \nmaintain the Department’s high standards.  \n.  \nOn June 22, 2023, at 1847 hours, Officer Askew #6986 responded to a 415V radio call involving \nroommates fighting and someone reportedly swinging a golf club at Pershing Avenue and University \nAvenue. Upon arrival\nwas already detaining a possible suspect\n. \nOfficer Askew walked over and handcuffed\n had injuries to his head and right arm and \nstated that he had been assaulted by his roommate\n. Officers requested medics to evaluate \n injuries.  \n \nDuring the detention, medics arrived to treat \n for his injuries. Officers stated they believed \n was a victim of 245(a)(1) PC (Assault with a Deadly Weapon). They also stated they were \nunsure if\nwas a suspect of 245(a)(1) PC or 594 PC (vandalism) since the other roommate had \nfled the location.  \n \nultimately refused to be transported to the hospital by ambulance. Officer Askew told \nthat he did not have a choice in receiving treatment. Officer Askew told\nhe would either be going \nto the hospital by ambulance or in the back of a patrol vehicle.\nsigned an AMA waiver (Against \nMedical Advice) and refused medical transport by ambulance. Medics advised the officers that\nhad the right to refuse transport. Officer Askew transported\nto the hospital handcuffed.  \n \nUpon arriving at the hospital, multiple nurses and staff members stated Officer Askew was demanding \nbe placed in an examination room. Officer Askew also demanded that\nbe given X-Rays \nand CT scans. Medical staff heard Officer Askew say he had transported the patient to the hospital after \n refused medical transport. They also heard Officer Askew say that if\nattempted to walk \naway, he would place\non a 5150 W&I.  \n \nMedical staff asked several times if the patient was under arrest or on a 5150 W&I. Medical staff \noverheard an officer say multiple times that he was not under arrest and not on a 5150 W&I. Medical staff \nlater asked the question again to gain further clarification on why the officers were at the hospital they \nheard an officer say, “He is under arrest now.”  \n \n later submitted an arrest report, requesting a notify warrant for misdemeanor vandalism \nper 594(B)(2)(A) PC. Officers left the hospital without booking \ninto County Jail.  \n \nSDPD Department Policy 9.15: Performance of Duty Policy, revised January 26, 2004, states: \n \nMembers shall maintain sufficient competency to properly perform their duties and assume the \nresponsibilities of their positions. Members shall perform their duties in a manner that will \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 102 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nmaintain the highest standards of efficiency in carrying out the functions and objectives of the \nDepartment. Unsatisfactory performance may be demonstrated by, but is not limited to, a lack of \nknowledge of the application of laws required to be enforced, an unwillingness or inability to \nperform assigned tasks, or the failure to conform to work standards established for the member's \nrank, grade or position.  \n \nOfficers shall not fail to take appropriate action on the occasion of a crime disorder or other \ncondition deserving police attention or be absent without leave or be unnecessarily absent from \ntheir assigned area during a tour of duty.  \n \nThe following will be considered prima facie evidence of unsatisfactory performance for all \nmembers: repeated poor performance evaluations or a written record of repeated infractions of the \nDepartment’s policies, procedures, directives, or orders. \n \nCity of San Diego Employee Performance Plan (Rank of POII), states in part: \n \nMakes timely, sound decisions based on available information and experience. \n \nDisplays tact, courtesy and good judgment when dealing with: \n• citizens; \n• co-workers; \n• supervisors. \n \nEstablishes and maintains rapport and communication with other units/divisions, City departments, other \nagencies and community-related groups. \n \nMaintains effective, cooperative relationships with personnel at all levels by: \n• securing cooperation of others without unnecessary friction; \n• willingly helping others; \n• working effectively with others in team efforts; \n• listening to and attempting to understand the viewpoints of others; \n• making constructive efforts to resolve problems in working relationships. \n \nDemonstrates the ability to conduct a thorough criminal investigation by: \n• routinely making appropriate attempts to identify and locate witnesses, victims and suspects; \n• accurately identifying all elements of the crime; \n• conducting thorough interviews and interrogations; \n• properly protecting crime scenes; correctly identifying, gathering and processing evidence \nAs described in allegations 1-3, Officer Askew detained and took custodial custody of\nand \nobtained his statement which was documented via BWC. Officer Askew relayed to \n and \nCONFIDENTIAL – DO NOT DUPLICATE \nInvestigator’s Report \nComplaint:  IA 2023-0345 \nPage 103 \n \n \n \nReporting Officer: \nT. Doherty, Sergeant \nID: \n6372 \nDivision \nInternal Affairs \nApproved by: \n \nT. Schmottlach, Lieutenant #5682 \nDate of Report: \nOctober 11, 2023 \n \nthat \n was uncooperative, however BWC contradicts this. While\n was not \nentirely forthcoming regarding his involvement in the crime, he did provide valid and good statements \nwhich should have been recorded by Officer Askew.\nstatement in conjunction with witness \nstatements provided verification that a felony crime had occurred, and\nwas the victim of that \ncrime. Officer Askew, however, became fixated on transporting\n to the hospital and passing the \ninvestigation off to\n instead of evaluating the crime and the facts presented to him. In \ntaking shortcuts, Officer Askew erroneously relayed that\nwas uncooperative.\nwas only \nargumentative with Officer Askew when Officer Askew wrongly told \n he had to receive medical \ntreatment and had to be transported to a hospital.     \n \nOfficer Askew stated in his interview that he was working extension of shift overtime to assist with \nbackfilling patrol staffing. Officer Askew said \n became the case agent because it was late \nin the shift (1900 hours), he was working overtime, and \n would have been working later \nthan himself. Officer Askew stated he never completed a report because\n had “the \ndetainment covered”. Officer Askew acknowledged that he had spoken to\n the longest and\nstated he never obtained a statement from\n. Knowing this information, Officer Askew \nshould have at a minimum completed an ARJIS-9 for his involvement in this case.  \n \nAs described in allegation 3, Officer Askew transported\n to the hospital where he failed to display \ntact, courtesy, or good judgement when dealing with hospital staff. Officer Askew acknowledged that he \nwas involved in several arguments with staff. Hospital staff discussed how Officer Askew made them feel \nuncomfortable and that he was disruptive to the operations occurring at the hospital. \n \nFinally, Officer Askew showed a lack of knowledge of laws as applied to 5150 W&I,  a lack of \nunderstanding the application of detention vs. arrest, and was wrong in assessing that we could force \nsomeone to receive medical treatment when they are cognizant and able to make decisions for themselves. \nOfficer Askew stated in his interview that he believed he could use 5150 W&I to overrule highly trained \nmedical professionals if he didn’t agree with their assessment.   \n \nOfficer Askew stated in his interview he felt the medics and the hospital staff were liable for not wanting \nto transport or treat\n. Officer Askew failed to recognize that by law patients have that right to \nrefuse treatment and transport. The medical wavier which\nsigned, takes away the liability from \nthe ambulance company. Officer Askew instead of honoring the patients right to refuse, unnecessarily \ntook on additional liability when he falsely arrested \n and transported him to the hospital after the \nmedical waiver was signed. \n \nBased on the totality of the circumstances Officer Askew did not meet the highest standards of efficiency \nin carrying out the functions and objectives of the department. Officer Askew showed a lack of \nknowledge in laws, showed an unwillingness to perform tasks, and failed to adhere to work standards as \nspecified in the performance plan. Therefore, this allegation is SUSTAINED. \n \n8/7/23, 9:48 AM\nI/NetViewer : Event

The BWC footage \npartially captured the incident. The footage was later uploaded onto a secure server on Evidence.com.\nOn Wednesday, 05/03/23, I was working as a Deputy Sheriff wearing a full \"Class D\" utility uniform \nthat clearly identified me as a Deputy Sheriff with the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office (ACSO), in my \nfully marked patrol vehicle (3398), assigned to patrol at the Eden Township Substation (ETS) in San \nLeandro.\nAbout 0419 hours, ACSO Transit Deputies requested emergency cover for a suspicious person (S1) \nwho had physically assaulted an operator of a Alameda County Transit Bus at the San Leandro BART \nStation located at 1401 San Leandro Boulevard in San Leandro.\nSergeant S. Light and Deputies M. Ella, P. Serrano, O. Sallam, and Z. Snider arrived to assist.\nUpon my arrival, I saw Deputies Serrano and Ella attempting to place S1 into handcuffs. S1 was on a \nconcrete divider, where the buses load and unload passengers directly in front of the BART station. S1\nwas on his left side and was thrashing his legs wildly and violently in an attempt to escape from the \ndeputies.\nI rushed to help and was able to place S1’s legs into a figure-four-leg-lock. S1 did not resist my efforts \nto place his legs into this control hold.\nDeputies Serrano and Ella placed S1 into handcuffs and detained him on the northeast curb line of the \nconcrete divider. S1 displayed obvious signs and symptoms of recent illicit drug use. S1 was sweating \nprofusely, had a thick white coating on top of his tongue, and displayed wild and erratic behaviors. S1 \nwas non-compliant and would not comply or listen to any of the deputies’ commands.\nREPORT DATE / TIME\nMay 3, 2023 05:47\nEVENT START DATE / TIME - EVENT END DATE / TIME\nMay 3, 2023 04:19 - 05:30\nREPORTING OFFICER\nLayne Olson #2533\nSUPPLEMENT TYPE\nUse of Force\nPg  of \n2\n4\nReport # 23-006308 - Supplement - 1 Report Alameda County Sheriff's Office\nPg  of \n2\n4\nAlameda County Sheriff's Office\nMark43 RMS Form v2.0 generated by C.

S1 began to thrash \nhis body wildly and kick his legs towards deputies. S1 attempted to scoot away on his hands and feet, \nwhile handcuffed, and screamed, “Let me go! Fuck you!”\nALCO Fire and a Falck ambulance later arrived to medically evaluate the victim of the assault and S1.\nSergeant Light arrived on scene, and I asked him to bring the WRAP to help control S1’s erratic and \ncombative behavior.\nThe WRAP is a safety restraint device used to prevent the subject from injuring himself and others.\nMultiple deputies attempted to control S1’s active resistance and his combative behavior. I gave S1 \nmultiple commands to stop resisting and to relax. S1 did not comply and continued to kick at deputies \nand thrash his body. Multiple deputies attempted to control S1’s upper body/torso. Deputies continued \nto give S1 commands to stop fighting and to stop resisting, but S1 did not comply.\nI assisted Sergeant Light and the other involved deputies in placing S1 into the WRAP. During this \nattempt to place him into the WRAP, S1 continued to thrash his body, swung his head side to side \nwildly, and kicked his legs towards us. I used my knees and placed them on the back of S1’s calves to \nadd pain compliance. S1 continued to thrash and fight my weight, which was on top of his calves.\nDeputy Serrano and Salam rolled S1 over, so he was sitting upright to finish the placement of the \nWRAP. I remained in control of S1’s legs.\nI told Deputy Snider to place a Chicago Spit Mask on S1’s head to prevent him from spitting at \ndeputies. Deputy Snider placed the spit mask on his head but did not maintain control over S1’s head. \nSimultaneously, S1 kicked his legs upwards, which knocked me off balance, and I fell forward towards \nS1’s face. I stopped myself from falling forward and retained my balance. S1 saw that my face was \nexposed, and I saw him draw his head backwards and then he forcefully head butted me on the right \nside of my face. This caused immediate pain on my right temple and behind my right eye. At the time \nof this incident, I did not have any substantial swelling or bruising.\nIt should be noted, Sergeant Light and all of the other involved deputies witnessed S1 purposely head \nbutt me on the right side of my face.\nOnce I was struck in my face, Sergeant Light removed me from the incident to ensure I sustained a \nsevere headache and pain behind my right eye.\nPg  of \n3\n4\nReport # 23-006308 - Supplement - 1 Report Alameda County Sheriff's Office\nPg  of \n3\n4\nAlameda County Sheriff's Office\nMark43 RMS Form v2.0 generated by C.

Pursuant to Alameda County General Order 8.17, my \nBWC was deactivated while discussing sensitive, tactical  and investigative information. My BWC \n,\nfootage was later annotated and uploaded to a secure server.\nOn Monday, July 3, 2023, I was assigned as a Patrol Sergeant at the Eden Township Substation \n(ETS). About 0157 hours, Emergency Services Dispatch (ESD) advised an anonymous female caller \nreported hearing a vehicle collision in the area of Liberty Street and 163  Avenue in San Leandro \nfollowed by sounds of subjects running downhill. The female caller advised she was unsure if there \nwere any injuries and did not know how many subjects were involved.\nAs \nnits responded to the area, ESD provided an updated location of Liberty Street at the I-580 \npatrol u\nEast exit ramp. About 0158 hours, ESD advised California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers were at 163\nAvenue and Liberty Street with a non-injury vehicle collision.\nAbout the same time as ESD rovided an update of the non-injury accident, Deputy A. Perez-Rojas \np\nwas driving eastbound on 163  Avenue from East 14  Street towards Liberty Street, when he advised \nhe was on-scene with CHP. Almost immediately upon Deputy Perez-Rojas’ arrival, he requested \n“Code 3” cover. “Code 3” cover is a request for units to expedite their response utilizing their \nemergency lights and siren. Deputy Perez-Rojas repeated his request for “Code 3” cover two separate \ntimes.\nAbout 0159 hours, Deputy Perez-Rojas broadcast shots had been fired and the location of \n \nAvenue. Deputy Perez-Rojas then requested “Code 3” cover, “Code 3” medical, followed by \nbroadcasting CHP was fighting with a subject who was trying to grab their gun. As \nnits were \npatrol u\narriving on scene, Deputy Perez-Rojas additionally advised one CHP Officer was outstanding. An \nadditional radio broadcast reported injuries to include a gun shot wound to the chest and a CHP \nOfficer with head injuries.\nAbout 0201 hours, Lieutenant C. Mears and I arrived on scene in separate vehicles. Deputies Z. \nSnider and A. Martos had arrived on scene moments before Lieutenant Mears and me. As I ran \ntowards \n Avenue, I passed a unknown CHP Officer who was walking a handcuffed \nHispanic male to one of their patrol vehicles, parked several houses east of \n Avenue. \nDeputies Snider and Martos were in the process of rendering medical aide to an unknown Hispanic \nREPORT DATE / TIME\nJul 4, 2023 02:49\nEVENT START DATE / TIME - EVENT END DATE / TIME\nJul 3, 2023 01:57 - 06:45\nREPORTING OFFICER\nRyan Romeril #1217\nSUPPLEMENT TYPE\nAssisting Narrative\nrd\nrd\nrd\nth\nrd\nrd\nrd\nPg  of \n2\n5\nReport # 23-009618 - Supplement - 16 Report Alameda County Sheriff's Office\nPg  of \n2\n5\nAlameda County Sheriff's Office\nMark43 RMS Form v2.0 generated by C.

I recalled Deputy Perez-Rojas instructing Deputies Snider and Martos \nto utilize a chest seal for the injured Hispanic male.\nI asked Deputy Perez-Rojas where the CHP Officer was who had fired his service weapon. Deputy \nPerez-Rojas directed me to three CHP Officers who were in the street in front of \n Avenue. I \napproached the CHP Officers and immediately noticed one CHP Officer, later identified as Officer R. \nHardin, who appeared out of breath and asked him if he had fired his service weapon. CHP Officer \nHardin advised he had not, however another CHP Officer, later identified as Officer B. Qurishi, had a \nvisible golf ball size contusion and bruising to his forehead, advised he had fired one shot. Unaware \nthat Deputy Perez-Rojas had fired any shots at this point, I escorted the CHP Officer Qurishi away \nfrom the scene and asked him about his injuries. CHP Officer Qurishi advised he was fighting with a \nsuspect. I asked if his Sergeant was enroute and he advised he was. As I stood with CHP Officer \nQurishi, I requested Deputy Perez-Rojas have the next arriving unit start taking photographs of the \nscene. Deputy Perez-Rojas responded, “I fired.”\nLearning Deputy Perez-Rojas had fired his service weapon, I had him stay with me away from the \nscene as I advised Lieutenant Mears that Deputy Perez-Rojas and a CHP Officer Qurishi had both \nfired their service weapons. At this point I directed Deputy Perez-Rojas \n his BWC, meaning \nde-activate\nto turn his BWC into buffering mode, \n not recording.\nand\nLieutenant Mears stood by with the CHP Officer Qurishi as I moved Deputy Perez-Rojas further away \nfrom the CHP Officer Qurishi to prevent any conversation between them regarding the incident. \nDeputy Perez-Rojas appeared stunned by the events which had just unfolded, and I instructed him to \ntake some deep breaths to assist him with regaining his composure.\nAs Deputy Perez-Rojas was taking a moment to gain his composure, San Leandro Police Department \nOfficer Q. May approached me and asked what he could assist with. I directed Officer May to stay with \nthe CHP Officer so Lieutenant Mears could continue to assist with managing the scene. Refer to \nOfficer May’s San Leandro Police Report # 23-24312.\nI returned my attention to Deputy Perez-Rojas, who spontaneously told me, “That dude was fighting \nfor his life.” I believed Deputy Perez-Rojas was referring to injured CHP Officer Qurishi. I Instructed \nDeputy Perez-Rojas he did not need to say anything else. Deputy Perez- Rojas asked if he could take \na little walk. I walked next to Deputy Perez-Rojas who had momentary emotional moment where he \nteared up and as he turned and hugged me stating, “I thought he was going to die man.” I encouraged \nDeputy Perez-Rojas to stop talking and to take several additional deep breaths.\nAbout 0205 hours, I read Deputy Perez-Rojas the Public Safety Statement from my ACSO Public \nSafety Statement pocket card. I asked Deputy Perez-Rojas what direction he fired rounds? Deputy \nPerez-Rojas replied two rounds \nin a northeast direction. I advised Deputy Perez-Rojas to \nwere fired \nonly answer the questions I asked him. I asked Deputy Perez-Rojas if there were any other injured \npersons besides the CHP Officer Qurishi and the suspect injured in the driveway  Deputy Perez-Rojas \n.\nadvised, “Not that he was aware of.” I asked Deputy Perez-Rojas if there were any other outstanding \nsubjects  Deputy Perez-Rojas advised he only saw two subjects and was unaware of anyone else \n.\noutstanding, but he advised to check with CHP. I asked Deputy Perez-Rojas if there was any evidence \nother than the known crime scene which needed to be protected. He advised other than the shell \nrd\nrd\nPg  of \n3\n5\nReport # 23-009618 - Supplement - 16 Report Alameda County Sheriff's Office\nPg  of \n3\n5\nAlameda County Sheriff's Office\nMark43 RMS Form v2.0 generated by C.

I completed the Public Safety \nStatement with Deputy Perez-Rojas and \n my camera.\nde-activated\nAt the request of Deputy Perez-Rojas, Deputy F. Millan was assigned as his companion. I instructed \nDeputy Millan to transport Deputy Perez-Rojas to ETS to meet with Sergeant B. Kimzey.\nAt the conclusion of speaking with Deputy Perez-Rojas, Lieutenant Mears briefly spoke with him. At \nthe same time Alameda County Fire arrived on scene and pronounced the suspect who had been shot \ndeceased at 0209 hours.\nI spoke with the CHP Officer Hardin, who advised there was one outstanding suspect who fled from \nthe vehicle. CHP Officer Hardin advised three suspects fled from the vehicle and the outstanding \nsuspect was last seen fleeing northbound over a fence at \n Avenue. The suspect was \ndescribed as a Hispanic male, five feet seven inches to five feet eight inches wearing a black ski \nmask, black shirt.\nAbout 0213 hours, CHP Sergeant B. Lehr arrived on scene, and I provided him a brief synopsis of the \nlimited information I had obtained up to this point. I advised the CHP Sergeant Lehr his officer (Officer \nQurishi) was being treated by Alameda County Fire and Falck Paramedics and escorted him to their \nlocation.\nAt this time Lieutenant Mears and I established the Control Point, which was located at the \nintersection of Bevil Way and 163  Avenue. Units on scene were tasked with perimeter positions, \nlocations to canvass and perimeter patrol to attempt to locate the outstanding suspect.\nAbout 0234 hours, I requested ACSO’s Unmanned Ariel Systems (UAS) Unit respond to conduct a \ncheck for our outstanding suspect.\nAbout 0300 hours, Deputy D. Frazer of our UAS Unit arrived on scene and I provided him with an \nupdate of the outstanding suspects last known location. I requested Deputy Frazer check the area for \nany potential hot spots or areas of interest deputies should check for the outstanding suspect.\nAbout 0310 hours, Deputy Frazer advised he had visual of an unknown person hiding behind garbage \ncans on the southwest corner of \n Avenue. Deputy Frazer showed me the live image which \nshowed the subject, later identified as \n \n was within the crime scene in \n-year-old \nthe front yard of the residence. Several deputies and I approached the location and I gave verbal \ncommands to \n advising him we knew he was there and to show me his hands. I provided \nadditional commands to \n who was detained without incident. \n was wearing all black \nclothing including a black ski mask. \n was escorted from the crime scene to a patrol vehicle on \n163  Avenue. I asked \n if he was injured or in need of medical assistance and replied no. \nUnsure why \n was hiding within the crime scene, I asked him, “Why he was hiding back \nthere?”, referring to hiding behind the trash cans. \n asked if I could pull down his ski mask, \nwhich I did. \n went on to say, “I was picked up by my friends and we over here riding, right. I \ndid know it was a stolen car.” I stopped \n from speaking any further informing him I did not \nneed to ask him any more questions at the time as he had just placed himself as an involved suspect \nin the investigation.\nrd\nrd\nrd\nPg  of \n4\n5\nReport # 23-009618 - Supplement - 16 Report Alameda County Sheriff's Office\nPg  of \n4\n5\nAlameda County Sheriff's Office\nMark43 RMS Form v2.0 generated by C.

Moments later, \n opened the front \ndoor and said \n was not home. Officer Hernandez stated \n was cooperative \nbecause \n was talking to them but uncooperative at the same time because \n did \nnot allow them inside the house. Officer Hernandez felt \n was hiding something \nfrom them based on how \n acted.  \n \nAs Officer Duran spoke with \n, \n came to the front door. Officer Hernandez \nfelt \n was hiding something; therefore, he handcuffed \n pending further \ninvestigation. Officer Hernandez told \n \n was not arrested and was just being \ndetained. Officer Hernandez had \n sit on a nearby bench outside the home's patio \narea. \n \nOfficer Hernandez stayed outside the house, standing beside \n while Officer Franco \nand Officer Duran spoke with \n inside \n home. Officer Hernandez did not see \nhow Officer Duran and Officer Franco entered the house since he was occupied with \n. \n \nOfficer Hernandez explained the call for service to \n, but \n told him there \nshould not be a restraining order against him because he had already taken care of that \nin court. \n said \n had a copy of the court order, which stated \n could be in the \nhome. \n advised \n did not live in \n home for approximately one year until he fixed \nthe restraining order conditions with the court. Once the restraining order conditions were \ncleared, \n moved back into \nhome. \n told Officer Hernandez \n had a lawyer \nand wanted to speak to him. Officer Hernandez stopped asking \n any other \nquestions.  \n \nOfficer Hernandez did not read all the restraining order conditions until after the officers \nwere inside the home. When Officer Hernandez read the conditions of the restraining \norder, he realized that \n could be at the house as long as he did not harass \n.  \n \nOfficer Edgar Franco Interview:      \n \nOn November 30, 2023, Sergeant Serrato interviewed Officer Franco.  \n \nOfficer Franco was hired as an entry-level Police Officer on April 3, 2023, and was in the \nField Training Program during this incident. Officer Franco was in his third phase of \ntraining, and his field training officer was Officer Duran. \n \nOfficer Franco advised that on July 18, 2023, Officer Duran, Officer Hernandez, and he \nwere dispatched to a call for service at \n \n \n in the City of Oxnard \nreference checking the well-being of \n who had a restraining order against \n.  \n \nIA #23-63 Investigation Report \n \n \n \n \nAugust 23, 2023 \n \n6 \n \nOfficer Duran called Officer Vazquez, who indicated that she had generated the call for \nservice and confirmed an active restraining order against \n. After they confirmed the \ninformation, they responded to the residence.  \n \nAs they walked to the front door, Officer Franco did not hear anything or see anyone in \nthe area. Nobody was screaming or yelling for help. The officers knocked on the front \ndoor, and \n answered it. Officer Duran told \n they were there to check on \n’s well-being and asked if \n was home. \n said \n was fine and \nwas upstairs in the house. When officers asked if they could check on \n’s welfare, \n said, “Oh no, well, \n not even here anymore.” Officer Franco felt that \n \nwas trying to hide something from them. Officer Franco felt that \n did not want to \nlet them check on \n, which “raised red flags.”  \n \nDuring this time, \n came out of the house, and Officer Hernandez detained \n \nOfficer Franco said \n tried closing the door on them, and that is when he entered \nthe house with Officer Duran to check on \n’s well-being. Based on how \n \nacted, Officer Franco felt they had exigent circumstances to enter the home. \n \nOfficer Franco obtained \n’s cell phone number, and he called \n \n told \nOfficer Franco \nwas outside \n house with \n. Officer Franco met with \n, and initially, \n was surprised that the police were at \n house. \n told \nOfficer Franco that \n did talk to \n about \n, but stated everything was \nfine. \n said \noccasionally argued with \n, but overall, everything was \nadequate. \n wanted to know if \n still had a restraining order against \n. \nTherefore, \n asked \n \n \nSergeant Miranda was contacted in order to guide the officers on what to do next. Officer \nFranco did not recall whether he had read the restraining order and the conditions.  \n \nOfficer Franco typically handled the calls for service when he was in field training with \nOfficer Duran, but because this call was “super complicated,” Officer Duran took over as \nthe primary officer. Depending on the call for service and the circumstances, Officer \nDuran would assist Officer Franco if he needed help with his calls for service.   \n \nBody Worn Camera (BWC) Video Review: \n \nSergeant Serrato reviewed the body-worn camera videos of the officers on the scene. \nBelow is the summary of the BWC footage: \n \nOfficers arrived on scene at approximately 1905 hours. Officer Hernandez rang the \ndoorbell to the residence, and \n answered the door. Officer Duran asked \n if \nshe could speak with \n, and \n said, “Yes.” \n went inside \n house and \nclosed the front door. Moments later,\n returned, walked out of the house, closed the \ndoor behind \n and told the officers that \n was not home.  \n \nIA #23-63 Investigation Report \n \n \n \n \nAugust 23, 2023 \n \n7 \n \nOfficer Hernandez asked \n if they could check inside \n house to confirm \n \nwas not home, and \n said, “No.” \n said \ncould “imagine why you’re here” but \nrefused to answer questions. Officer Duran asked \n if there was another adult in \nthe house, and \n said \n was home but refused to give \n name (\n \nappeared disturbed by the officers’ presence). Moments later, \n walked out of the \nhouse using the front door. Officer Hernandez instructed \n to walk away from the \nfront door. \n initially refused but subsequently followed his instructions. Officer \nHernandez handcuffed \n and told \nwas not under arrest. \n \nDuring this time, \n walked back into \n house. \n told Officer Duran, “You \ncan’t come inside my house.” Officer Duran told \n she needed to check \nhouse \nto see if \n was home. \n asked Officer Duran, “Do you have a warrant to enter \nmy house?”  \n \nOfficer Duran told \n if \n prevented them from doing their “lawful duties” to check \non the welfare of the \n could be liable “from being arrested.” Officer Duran \nasked \n if \nrefused to comply with a lawful order, and \n said, “Yes.”  \n \nOfficer Duran and Officer Franco entered the residence and handcuffed \n. Officer \nDuran escorted \n outside the home and had \n sit next to \n as Officer Franco \nstayed inside.  \n \nOfficer Duran asked dispatch for a Sergeant to respond. Officer Duran asked \n if \n took her back inside the house if \n would be willing to speak to her, and \n said \nyes. Officer Duran walked \n back inside the house, and they walked to the living \nroom. Officer Duran read \nMiranda advisement.  \n \nOfficer Duran asked \n if \nknew \n had a restraining order and was not \nsupposed to be at the house. \n said, “There isn’t an active restraining order,” and \nthe order did not prohibit \n from being in the house. Officer Franco showed \n \nthe stay-away order on file on his cell phone. \n said the restraining order was \nremoved.  \n \nOfficer Duran took \n’s handcuffs off and asked if \n was home. \n said \n initially thought \n was home but discovered \n was not when \nwent inside \nto check for \n  \n \n told Officer Franco that \n initially did not allow them inside \n home because \n was trying to protect \n in the house. \n said \nhas been \nhaving problems with \n because \nthrows “fits” when things do not go \nway. \n \nOfficer Duran walked out of the house and contacted Sergeant Jaime Miranda, who had \njust arrived on scene. Officer Duran had a private conversation with Sergeant Miranda \nand muted her BWC.  \n \nIA #23-63 Investigation Report \n \n \n \n \nAugust 23, 2023 \n \n8 \n \nAfter the private conversation, Sergeant Miranda and Officer Duran contacted \n \ninside the house. Officer Duran asked \n again if \n was home in front of \nSergeant Miranda. \n said \n was unsure if \n was home because \nother \n told \n was not home, but \n never checked \nto confirm. \n \nsaid\n had not checked \n’s room.  \n \nOfficer Duran, Officer Franco, and \n walked around the house to check if \n \nwas home.  \n was not located inside the house. Officer Franco obtained \n’s \nphone number from \n, and he called \n. Officer Franco got a hold of \n \nby phone, and \nsaid \n was outside with \n.  \n \nOfficer Franco and Sergeant Miranda walked outside the house and met with \n. \n said \n asked \n what was going on with the sexual assault case \ninvolving \n. \n said \nwas the \n \nwhich took place five years ago. \n said nothing was going on with \n now, and \neverything was fine. \n said \n was only inquiring about the case to \n \n \nOfficer Duran walked over to \n, who was with Officer Franco. \n told officers \ncould stay with her \n Officer Duran walked back to the home and briefly \nspoke with \n, who was still seated outside the home beside Officer Hernandez \nwithout handcuffs. Officer Duran walked back inside the residence to talk to \n. \nSergeant Miranda showed Officer Duran \ncell phone and told her he did not see a stay-\naway order for \n on the court order. Officer Duran said it must have been “amended.” \nOfficer Duran took the phone from Sergeant Miranda, looked at the court order, and \nreturned the phone.  \n \nOfficer Duran walked over to \n and told \n she was going to generate a report and \nsubmit it to the District Attorney's Office for review regarding this incident. All officers \nsubsequently cleared the area, and no arrests were made. \n \nOfficer Angelica Duran Interview:      \n \nOn September 20, 2023, Sergeant Serrato served Officer Duran with a notice regarding \nan administrative investigation. Officer Duran agreed to provide an interview on October \n17, 2023. Commander Vazquez and Sergeant Serrato were present during the interview. \nOfficer Duran was read her Miranda rights and refused to waive them.  Officer Duran was \nadvised of the Administrative Admonishment (Lybarger), which she stated and signed \nthat she understood. The following is a summary of the interview: \nIA #23-63 Investigation Report \n \n \n \n \nAugust 23, 2023 \n \n9 \n \nIA #23-63 Investigation Report \n \n \n \n \nAugust 23, 2023 \n \n10 \n \nIA #23-63 Investigation Report \n \n \n \n \nAugust 23, 2023 \n \n11 \n \nOther Related Information: \n \nDispatch Call Center Recording \n \nThe following is a summary of information provided by Officer Vazquez to the Dispatch \nCall Center regarding the call for service: \n Officer Vazquez told dispatch to generate a call for service reference checking the \nwell-being of \n. \n Officer Vazquez told dispatch there was an active restraining order against \n, \nand \nwas not supposed to be at the home.  \n \nComputer Aided Dispatch (CAD) Report Review \n \nThe following is a summary of relevant information from the CAD Report: \n Dispatch Narrative: Dispatched confirmed \n was served with a criminal \nprotective order; the protective person was \n and \n was allowing \n \nto stay in the home.  \n Court Information (Court Order) was included in the CAD report, which was \navailable for officers to review while responding to the call for service.  The order \nstates the protected person is \n and the restrained person is \n. The \norder states the restrained person can contact the protected person. The court \norder was effective as of February 1, 2021, and the expiration date is on February \n1, 2024. The court order also has all the conditions that must be followed by the \nrestrained person.  \n \nCourt Order \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIA #23-63 Investigation Report \n \n \n \n \nAugust 23, 2023 \n \n12 \n \nConclusion:  \n \nThe following factors were considered regarding Officer Duran’s allegation of exceeding \nlawful peace officer powers by unlawfully entering the residence and detaining \n: \n● Officer Duran admitted that she did not hear or see any sounds of distress from \noccupants inside the apartment or the immediate area that would warrant exigent \ncircumstances to enter the residence. \n● Officer Duran admitted entering the house without a warrant or consent from \n.  \n● Officer Duran’s justification of entering the house to check on \n’s well-being \nwas insufficient to justify the exigent entry and circumvent the Fourth Amendment \nof the US Constitution. Additional information and circumstances would be needed \nto establish that \n was in distress, such as crying, calling for help, or \ninformation that \n and the children inside were the possible victims of lewd \nor lascivious crimes. \n● Officer Duran did not obtain enough information to establish enough facts and \nprobable cause to justify an exigent entry into the apartment to check the well-\nbeing of \n. Subsequently, placing \n into handcuffs was not warranted \nbased on \n’s refusal to consent to a search of her residence.  \n● Officer Duran did not direct officers to gain additional facts to establish a \ncompelling argument that a person or persons inside the apartment were in \ndistress and were in danger of life or well-being.  \nBased on the information gathered, it is my recommendation of the allegation that Officer \nDuran violated DEPARTMENT POLICY 340.3.5(u):  Exceeding lawful peace officer \npowers by unreasonable, unlawful, or excessive conduct be sustained. \nThe following factors were considered regarding Officer Duran’s allegation of \nunsatisfactory work performance: \n● Officer Duran did not conduct a proper investigation to establish a compelling \nargument that she needed to go inside the apartment. She did not review the court \norder to establish enough facts and probable cause to justify an exigent entry into \nthe apartment to check the well-being of \n. Subsequently, placing \n \ninto handcuffs was not warranted based on \n’s refusal to consent to a search \nof \nresidence.  \n● Once \n walked out of the house and was detained, Officer Duran should have \ninvolved a sergeant immediately.  \n● Officer Duran admitted that she should have slowed everything down once the \nrestrained person/suspect, \n, was detained outside the home.  \n● Officer Duran admitted it was her responsibility to confirm the restraining order and \nthe conditions before responding to the call for service. She did not verify the \nrestraining order and conditions this time because Officer Vazquez told her \n \nwas in violation.  \n● It is an officer's responsibility to confirm a restraining order and its conditions before \nenforcing the order. \nIA #23-63 Investigation Report \n \n \n \n \nAugust 23, 2023 \n \n13 \n \n● \n Additional due diligence should have been directed, such as: \no Have officers verify the conditions of the court order and verify the conditions \nof the order.  \no Have officers contact other neighbors to establish if they had heard or seen \nsigns of subjects in distress. \no Have officers use other methods, such as calling \n and trying to obtain \n’s phone number to call \nand check on \n before making entry. \nBased on the information gathered, it is my recommendation the allegation that Officer \nDuran violated DEPARTMENT POLICY 340.3.5 (c):  Unsatisfactory work performance \nincluding, but not limited to, failure, incompetence, inefficiency, or delay in performing \nand/or carrying out proper orders, work assignments, or instructions of supervisors \nwithout a reasonable and bona fide excuse be sustained.  \n1 of 25 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal Affairs Interview Report \n \n \n \nI.A. #:  \n \n23-63 \n \nInterview of:  \nAngelica Duran \n \nDate:  \n \n10/17/2023 \n \nInvestigator:  \nMiguel Serrato \n \n \n \nMS: \nMiguel Serrato \n \nRV: \nRicardo Vazquez \n \nAD: \nAngelica Duran \n \n \n \nMS: \nAll right.

You responded to the call for service with Officer Angelica Duran who was, I \nbelieve was your field training officer at the time…. \n23-63: Edgar Franco Interview \n(November 30, 2023) \n \n \n2 of 8 \n \nEF: \nYes sir.  \n \nMS: \n…..and Officer Eduardo Hernandez. Do you remember this call for service?  \n \nEF: \nYes.  \n \nMS: \nCan you tell me about this call for service from beginning to end?  \n \nEF: \nYes uh, I had been on uh, Phase 3, of uh field training with uh, Officer Duran. Um, if I \nremember correctly, the call was regarding check-the-well-being, a possible violation of a \nrestraining order. Dispatched um, had uh, I believe notified us that there was a restraining \norder in place. Um, to my recollection uh, we arrived at scene, um did a door knock um, \nat which point we contacted the \n um, and then we asked \n if, where \n children \nwere, or where the uh, r.p. was and, at first, \n said that \n was upstairs. Um, and then \nat that point, we asked \n if we could check um, to do a welfare check to see if \n was \nokay, and if anybody was inside the residence. And then uh, \n believ…\n started to \nact um, very hesitant, didn’t want to say anything further. Um, and then \n said “oh no, \nwell \n not even here anymore,” while we’re at scene. Um, and then that’s when we \nwere like okay, well it’s kind of now starting to raise red flags, ‘cause we’re there for, for \ncheck-the-well-being to make sure the well-being of the \n good. Um, at which point \nuh, \n tried to slam the door in our face, and I also felt that it was kind of like \nwas \ntrying to hide something as far as like, maybe the welfare of the child.  \n \nMS: \nUh huh.  \n \nEF: \nSo that’s when uh, we stepped into the house and wanted to check just to make sure the \n was okay and upstairs.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Um, what happened after that?  \n \nEF: \nUm, Officer Duran stayed and talked with the \n um, and then I was uh, I ended up uh, \ngetting in contact with the r.p. and I met \n outside, and it turned out that \n was not \ninside the residence, that \n was outside with \n boyfriend.  \n \nMS: \nYou say the r.p. Who, who was the actual r.p. though. Uh….. \n \nEF: \nIt was the, the \n  \n \nMS: \nOkay.  \n \nEF: \n‘Cause \n had been calling uh, I believe it was Crisis uh, I'm not sure. I, I, I think it was, \n was talking, \n had talked….spoken to a \n or Crisis Negotiation, I'm not \nsure….. \n \n \n \n \n \n23-63: Edgar Franco Interview \n(November 30, 2023) \n \n \n3 of 8 \nMS: \nUh huh.  \n \nEF: \n….um, and that generated the radio call as far as, placed her as the victim saying that \n \nhad felt a certain way because the person left at the house, that was the suspect of the \nrestraining order.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Okay, so the r.p. uh, who ended up being \n \n, the \nuh, \n \ntalk, \n talks to a \n. \n \nEF: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \n…the \n end up…ends up calling, or contacting\n…..uh \n uh who generate \nthe call for service.

So tell me about that contact with \n.  \n \nEF: \nUm, when I was contacting \n \n, it just seemed that um, \ndidn’t know why we \nwere there in the first place. \n was kind of like what’s going on? So, it was more of \nlike “hey, did you talk to somebody? Did you generate this? Did you tell them about your \nfeelings” and stuff, and \n was like “oh yeah, when I had spoke to uh, my \n \nabout this.” I was like “well how’s your relationship with,” I guess the suspect? The d.p.? \nAnd \n says uh, like it’s really not that bad; that they just had arguments every now and \nthen. And then, after that, we just decided like, trying to figure out what, what to do from \nthere. Contacted a supervisor and see what way to go.  \n \n23-63: Edgar Franco Interview \n(November 30, 2023) \n \n \n4 of 8 \nMS: \nOkay. Um, so when you guys, so you guys got the call for service.

They sent us a call.  \n \nMS: \nOkay.  \n \nEF: \nUm, and I think once we got on scene, I’m not sure if Eddie, or Duran um, checked to see \nif there was verification of the restraining order. ‘Cause while we were there uh, we also \ndetained the possible d.p. I actually don’t remember it quite well. Um, um, if they, if \nDispatch verified the restraining order, or if they just told us about it.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Um so you, you don’t remember reading the restraining order or looking at the \nconditions of the restraining order?  \n \nEF: \nNot at this point right now.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Uh, when you guys got there in the very beginning, all right? When you jus…you \nsay you guys door-knocked it um, did you guys see or hear anything when you guys, \nbefore you guys knocked at the front door?  \n \nEF: \nUh, like upstairs?  \n \nMS: \nUh, like anywhere. Like, like did you hear like screaming, yelling, um or was it… \n \nEF: \n \nNo.  \n \nMS: \n \n…… just kind of a normal call for service?  \n \nEF: \n \nIt was like a normal call for service.  \n \nMS: \n \nOkay. Um, so you told me tha…that you were in field training…. \n \nEF: \n \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \n \n….with Angelica, right? You say you…. \n \nEF: \n \nYes.  \n \n23-63: Edgar Franco Interview \n(November 30, 2023) \n \n \n5 of 8 \nMS: \n \nWhat phase were you in?  \n \nEF: \n \nUh 3.  \n \nMS: \nThree. Do you remember um, Day 1 here with Oxnard PD? Or Phase 1? Wha…what \nmonth did you get here?  \n \nEF: \n \nUh…. \n \nMS: \n \nIf you recall.  \n \nEF: \n \n…..I believe it was May or June.  \n \nMS: \n \nSo you, you started uh, in May or June of 2023 in Phase 1?  \n \nEF: \n \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \n \nUm, and then in July the 18th, on this call for service, you were in Phase 3 with Angelica?  \n \nEF: \n \nYes.  \n \nMS: \n \nUm, who was the primary for this call for service? Was it…. \n \nEF: \n \nMyself and uh, Officer Duran.  \n \nMS: \n \nOkay. Who did most of the talking?  \n \nEF: \nUm, mostly Officer Duran. I tried um, to speak, to take initiative to take the call over, but \nI feel that she knew that, due to the circumstances that we had that she felt the, the need \nto take it over and should, because it was super complicated.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Um, normally who…. normally who takes, uh control of a call for service?  \n \nEF: \nUh, the more senior…. \n \nMS: \nBut uh, we’re, we’re talking about you and Angelica, so like…. \n \nEF: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \n…like during that month when you were with Angelica, and I know you're in field \ntraining um, does she do ta…..um, is she in charge of the call for service mostly, or do \nyou take care of the call for service and, if you need help, then she’ll help you out?  \n \nEF: \nUh, I think it’s just dependent on the circumstances. If it’s something that I personally \nhaven't dealt with before, then she would uh, assist me best way to get through it. Uh, but \n23-63: Edgar Franco Interview \n(November 30, 2023) \n \n \n6 of 8 \nreferring back to this call um, it was just a lot of moving parts that um, we had to get \nverification with certain things and I believe she decided to take it over at that time.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Um, all right. So it was something done more like on the fly?  \n \nEF: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nSo it wasn’t like you guys talked….. \n \nEF: \nNo we didn’t.  \n \nMS: \n…..about it beforehand.  \n \nEF: \nNo.  \n \nMS: \nYou guys just got there, and just how everything was evolving…. \n \nEF: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \n….uh she ended up taking initiative and she took the call for service, more of the \nprimary, you were helping her out.  \n \nEF: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nUh, and then you ended….you ended up getting the phone number for \n and you \ntalked to \n in the parking lot….  \n \nEF: \nYes…. \n \nMS: \n…in the… \n \nEF: \n….. in the front of her….. \n \nMS \n….and that’s when \n kind of just told you what was going on…. \n \nEF: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \n….. (inaudible) surprised. Okay. All right. Um, anything else that I could have missed? \n \nEF: \nUm, no. We, I believe uh, just based off of the actions that we had uh, beginning, as far \nas like with the call that we got, the information we had at the time um, uh we felt like it \nwas exigent to go in uh, just because of the well-being of the child. Uh, we did not hear \nscreams. Um, and then we also notified a supervisor while at scene, and notified him of \nwhat had occurred as well.  \n \n23-63: Edgar Franco Interview \n(November 30, 2023) \n \n \n7 of 8 \nMS: \nUm, you mentioned uh, the per….uh, the suspect, uh \n \n.  \n \nEF: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \nDo you remember when you guys contacted \n? The….only if you remember.  \n \nEF: \nUm, from the little parts that I remember, uh we were asking uh, who else was inside the \nresidence, and when \n came downstairs, and I believe Officer Hernandez said that that \nwas \n. So we had \n come out and detained \n at the time um, because \n was \nnamed on the restraining order, I believe.  \n \nMS: \nAnd so, you first contact the \n, and then uh, \n \n, comes \nout…. \n \nEF: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \n….you guys detain \n…. \n \nEF: \nYes.  \n \nMS: \n…and this is all before you guys actually make entry to the house.  \n \nEF: \nYes.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. And then once \n was trying to slam the door on you guys, that’s when you guys \nmade, made entry.  \n \nEF: \nYes.  \n \nMS: \nAll right. At the time you, you felt that, it was your opinion that you had exigent \ncircumstances…. \n \nEF: \nYes.  \n \nMS: \n….to check on the welfare, welfare of the \n  \n \nEF: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nSo you, you (unintelligible). Okay. Do you have anything else to add to, to the interview \nthat I did not cover or do you think is important for me to know?  \n \nEF: \nUh, no.  \n \n23-63: Edgar Franco Interview \n(November 30, 2023) \n \n \n8 of 8 \nMS: \nAll right Edgar.

You \nresponded to the call for service along with Officer Angelica Duran and Officer Edgar \nFranco. Do you remember this call for service? \n \nEH: \nYes.  \n \nMS: \nUh, tell me about that call for service from beginning to end.  \n \nEH: \nI remember the call for service was uh, something eh, in, in the realm of uh, \n \nhad a restraining order against \n and the \n had disclosed to a \nt \nuh, that uh, the \n was, I, I believe it was uh, behavior that would violate the \nrestraining order, it may have been sexual, I don’t remember exactly what behavior the \n disclosed to the \n that the fa….\n was violating. Um, as we \nrespond there, Officer Duran was on the phone with uh, Officer Vazquez to confirm that \nthere was a restraining order on file and I believe at that time there was a restraining \norder on file, so we went to make contact with the um, residents at the address.  \n \nUm, I remember we knocked at the door. Uh we were uh, we were um, the \n of \n, uh \n responded, opened the door. \n didn’t have the door fully open, kind \nof had it a quarter open um, and to us, or to me anyways, it kind of seemed like \nknew \nwhy we were there and maybe \n was hiding something. Um, but uh, Officer uh, Duran \nexplained to \n that we were there to uh, check-the-well-being of \n and the \n seemed a little confused because \n said \n fine, and \n \nthere. \n eventually went to go check on \n after closing the door on us, uh \nwent to go check on \n, came back a short while later and said uh, “you know \nwhat? The….my \n not here.” And then a short time after that is when \n \n came to the door. Uh, Officer Duran, I believe, asked \n who \n was or if \n \nwas \n \n and \nstated that \nwas. At that point in time, uh just because I felt \nthat the, the \n uh, was trying to hide uh, what was really going on, I immediately uh \ncontacted \n and placed \nin my handcuffs and sat \n, there was this little bench \nnearby in the patio area, sat \n there. But I explained to \n uh, at least more than one \ntime, uh that \n wasn’t under arrest, simply \n was being detained because we were \ninvestigating uh, a matter.  \n \nUm, I ssss.…stood outside with \n and then, from what I remember, Officer Duran \nstepped inside to the living room with the \n and uh, had a conversation with \n. I \ndon’t recall what they were talking about. Uh, I do rember….at one point in time, I think \nthe \n began to cry or sob, recanting some story about the, the \n but I, I, I \ndon’t remember exactly what they were talking about.  \n \nMS: \n \nAll right.  \n \nEH: \n \nYeah.  \n \n23-63: Eduardo Hernandez Interview \n(October 18, 2023) \n \n \n3 of 7 \nMS: \nOkay. Um, when you arrived, uh at that call for service by the apartment complex, uh, as \nyou're walking to the apartment, to the front door…. \n \nEH: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \n….did you, what did you see or what did you hear, if anything?  \n \nEH: \nThat I can recall, uh I remember that we walked up to the, uh apartment complex, it was \nto the left, and it was the first house, I want to say, on the corner. Um, I don’t remember \nhearing anything and I don’t remember seeing anything. I don’t think there was anyone \noutside because it’s a little enclosed patio area, and there was no one there, so we just \nknocked at the door. I remember it was a two-story house.  \n \nMS: \nOkay, so uh, you, you didn’t even hear anybody crying or hear anybody screaming for \nhelp or anything like that? \n \nEH: \nNo.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Um, when you were, so you, you said th….after a while, you were talking to \n \n, right?  \n \nEH: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \nUm, did \n, did you, did \n tell you anything when you were contacting him?  \n \nEH: \n(unintelligible).  \n \nMS: \nWhen you put those handcuffs on \n?  \n \nEH: \nUh, from what I remember, \n didn’t. \n, I remember \n saying that, I explained to \nhim, from what I recall, that uh, there was a restraining order on file, we were vi….or and \ninvestigating the, the possible violation of the restraining order and that’s when \n \nmentioned that \n had taken uh, care of all that at court, \n may have a copy of the \nrestraining order in the house, uh but \n said that \n was allowed to be there because \n...I remember \n saying that \n didn’t live at that residence for about a year while \nthey were handling all that in court uh, but the court allowed \n to, to now live at the \nresidence. So \n was saying that \n wasn’t in violation, but \n didn’t have uh, a copy, or \n didn’t know where the copy of the restraining order was to show the update, ‘cause \nfrom what we knew, \n couldn’t have any contact…. \n \nMS: \nUh huh.  \n \nEH: \n….but he was saying that \n could. Um, the di…I think I do remember \n mentioning \nthat \n had a lawyer or, or wanted to call \n lawyer, um, so I don’t think we, we dove too \nmuch into, into the investigation.  \n23-63: Eduardo Hernandez Interview \n(October 18, 2023) \n \n \n4 of 7 \n \nMS: \nUh so, so after \n men….mentioned \n lawyer, you, you, you didn’t really question \n \nanymore.  \n \nEH: \nNo, not when \n mentioned \n lawyer.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Um, did \n ever mention anything about \n uh, about \n \n, the \n \n  \n \nEH: \nUh, I think \n did. I think \ndid mention \n and just that, from what I can recall, that \nthere were allegations, um but at…. that all that handled in court, which is why \n was \nsaying that \n was now allowed to live there with uh, the whole family because it got \nhandled in court and they were just allegations.  \n \nMS: \nUm, and during this time, when \n was telling you all this, where was Angelica and \nFranco? \n \nEH: \nUh, Officer Duran and, and Franco were…I want to say Officer Duran for sure was \ninside the living room with the \n, and I think Officer Franco either went in between \nboth of us, or I think he was outside with me for the majority of the time. I remember him \neventually leading me out to the street on, on \n A little later in the investigation, \ndid I think speak with the \n of uh, \n, but I think for the most part, I \nthink Franco was outside of the patio area with me.  \n \nMS: \nWhen you, when you guys first contacted the \num \n…. \n \nEH: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \n……um, \n’s \nname?  \n \nEH: \nUh, I don’t remember \nname but, from the report \n \n, \n yeah that \nlooks like it’s \n  \n \nMS: \n So \n, when \n first came to the front door, uh what was her demeanor?  \n \nEH: \nUh, from what I can remember, kind of like, like what are we doing there? Like why are \nwe there? And, and to me, it, it was cooperative in the sense that \n was talking to us, \nbut uncooperative in the sense that \ndidn’t want to let us into the house, uh from what \nI can recall, and didn’t have the door fully open. I remember \n you know, having \n \n head out the door and uh, us not being able to see completely into the living room. \nUm, and then yeah, \n shut the door on us when \n went to go check on \n daughter \nand came back out and, again, just had the door slightly ajar to where we can just see \n. \nUh, and nothing really further into that, so…..kind of almost seemed to me like \n was \nhiding something, like, like \nknew that, right off the bat, like my first thought was \n \n23-63: Eduardo Hernandez Interview \n(October 18, 2023) \n \n \n5 of 7 \nknew that the \n \n was in violation so \n was trying to hide \n is what I, \nis what I thought at that point in time. \n \nMS: \nOkay. Um, how did um, if you know, or if you recall, how, how did Angelica and Franco \nend up in, in the home?  \n \nEH: \nThat I don’t recall (unintelligible). I don’t know if sh…Angelica asked to go inside or \nasked if it was okay to go inside and speak with um, the, the \n Um, knowing \nAngelica, I'm sure that’s what she did, but I don’t recall if they just stepped in or walked \nin or, or, I don’t think they barged in to (unintelligible), but I don’t know if they just \nwalked in and kind of had a conversation there, or, or if they asked if they could walk in.  \n \nMS: \nSo is it fair to say that when (unintelligible), you were dealing with \n \n.  \n \nEH: \nYes.  \n \nMS: \nSo you, you weren’t really, you, you're…. \n \nEH: \nWasn’t, yeah. I wasn’t too sure and I didn’t pay attention to how the entry was made.  \n \nMS: \nGot it. Um, so we’re, we’re talking about this protective order or restraining order.  \n \nEH: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \nUh you said you, you were with Angelica when she called Lidia?  \n \nEH: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \nUh, and she said there was a restraining order on file. Uh, the conditions, do you \nremember them talking about the conditions of the restraining order?  \n \nEH: \nI do remember the….them speaking about it. It wasn’t ‘til after, when we were talking to \n that \n was mentioning that \n could be there, that we had them, ‘cause usually \nDispatch would put the copy of the restraining order on, on the call. And for whatever \nreason, maybe it just went over all of our heads, we should have all caught it, but when \nwe went to the call, the, the, the uh, restraining order uh, conditions weren’t on the call. I \nguess we just assumed that there was a restraining order on file and \n couldn’t be there; \n‘cause I think that’s how the call came out. So it wasn’t until later in the investigation uh, \nthat we had Dispatch put the conditions of the call on the call itself and I was able to look \nit up on the phone and see that there wasn’t anything there that said \n couldn’t be there. \nI think \nwas saying \n could be there as long as \n had peaceful contact, didn’t harass \nor demean \nor anything like that.  \n \nMS: \nOkay, so when you finally saw that on the, on your phone that \ncould be there, was this \nalready afterwards, after Angeli….was, were already inside the house?  \n23-63: Eduardo Hernandez Interview \n(October 18, 2023) \n \n \n6 of 7 \n \nEH: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nUh, so this is maybe towards the middle and the end of the investigation?  \n \nEH: \nYeah, probably towards the middle. Uh, yeah, definitely not at the beginning, it was \ntowards the middle when, when even the \n….uh, I can remember \n, now that I \nremember uh, kind of mentioning that there was, that, that \n was allowed to be there, \nand that they fixed it all in court, and then, I think at one point \n got a copy of, of the \norder, um, that I think showed that \n could be there but it wasn’t filed with the court, or \nit wasn’t updated with the courts. Um, yeah, now that I remember, I, I remember \n \nbringing out some, some papers, so that it was towards the middle / end of the \ninvestigation.  \n \nMS: \nThat paperwork sh….uh who did \n show that paperwork to?  \n \nEH: \nUh, Duran.  \n \nMS: \nDuran?  \n \nEH: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. And so you were primarily with \n. \n \nEH: \nYeah, I was outside and I remember \n having some papers and showing it to Officer \nDuran, from what I can recall.  \n \nMS: \nDid you ever enter the, the apartment?  \n \nEH: \nUh, towards the end, yes.  \n \nMS: \nAt the, at the very end…  \n \nEH: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Um, (unintelligible). Do you have anything else to add to the interview that I did \nnot cover or do you think is important to, or for me to know?  \n \nEH: \nUh, not, not that I can think of.  \n \nMS: \nUm, when you entered the, the apartment, was that uh, (unintelligible) Sergeant Miranda?  \n \nEH: \nSergeant Miranda was there and he had the….I think he was making sure that uh, \n \nwas grabbing her belongings ‘cause \n was going to go with \n So he went \nupstairs and then that’s when either \n’s s\n or \n’s \n arrived at the \n23-63: Eduardo Hernandez Interview \n(October 18, 2023) \n \n \n7 of 7 \nscene and were trying to be a little con….confrontational. And they were trying to walk \ninto the, into the house. “Hey, hold up. You guys wait outside, sergeant’s up there, he’s \nstill doing his thing.”  \n \nMS: \nOkay, so this is at the end when, when \n was go….getting her belongings so \n \ncould go with \n  \n \nEH: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Okay, that’s everything I have. So, after you leave this interview, should you recall \nanything that is different from the information you provided today, uh yo….you are \nordered to provide that information to me as soon as possible.  \n \nEH: \nOkay.  \n \nMS: \nDo you understand that?  \n \nEH: \nYes.  \n \nMS: \nUm, all right Eddie, that’s it. Um…. \n \nEH: \n(inaudible).  \n \nMS: \n….we are concluding uh, this interview. We’re concluding this interview.

I'm here with Sergeant uh, Jaime Miranda. It’s \nSeptember the 19th, 2023, and it’s about 1735 hours, and uh, I'm Sergeant \n Serrato. \nUh, Sergeant Miranda, you are being interviewed as a witness only to an administrative \ninvestigation. You are only a witness in this investigation and, if at any point that \nchanges, I will immediately stop this interview and we will reconvene at a later time. \nThis is strictly an administrative investigation. I am, therefore, now ordering you to \ndiscuss this matter with me. If you refuse to discuss this matter, your silence can be \ndeemed insubordination and result in an administrative discipline up to and including \ntermination. Any statement you make under compulsion of threat of such discipline \ncannot be used against you in a later criminal proceeding. I will ask you if you need a \nbreak every fifty minutes, uh and give you one if you need it. I don’t foresee this \ngoing…. \n \nJM: \n(inaudible).  \n \nMS: \n…..fifty minutes, but if it does, or you need an interview, just let me know. Um, this \ninterview is regarding a call for service where Officer Lidia Vazquez generated on July \n18th, 2023, reference checking the well-being of \n \n, who resides at \n \n \nin the city of Oxnard. Officer Angelica Duran ended up responding to the call \nfor service with Officer Edgar Franco and Officer Eduardo Hernandez. During that call, \n23-63: Jaime Miranda Interview \n(September 19, 2023) \n \n \n2 of 8 \nOfficer Duran asked for a sergeant and you responded. Do you remember this call for \nservice?  \n \nJM: \nI do.  \n \nMS: \nAll right. Uh, tell me about this call for service from beginning to end, what you recall.  \n \nJM: \nOkay. So, she asked for a Sam unit so I responded. When I got there, um Eddie, Eddie \nHernandez was out on the front porch. The \n or the \n, or the, the \n on the front porch um, Eddie’s standing next to \n in cuffs. Angie \ncame out to talk to me while her partner, I think, stayed inside with the \n who was in \nthe liv….on the living room couch. Angie came out, we muted our body cams, and she \nbasically gave me a rundown as to what she had so far at that point.  \n \nFrom what I remember her explaining to me was that it was a violation of a restraining \norder, that the \n was the restrained person, and the \n was the protected person. \nThe \n was supposedly living in the house and \n had been living in the house for \nsome time, and there was a third party that had called, which I later found it out it came \nthrough, I think like \n….the, the \n had called about….the \n had \ndisclosed to \n that \n was now living, had been living at the house, and \nthere was a restraining order. The \n had called as a mandated reporter to \n \n I think relayed that to us, which Lidia Vazquez took the call. Lidia Vazquez \ngenerated the call of, which was a check-the-well-being, and that’s why we ended up at \nthe house. So I understood that at that point. Um, Angelica told me there was a \nrestraining order, they had put it in the CAD notes. She had looked at it and it did show \nthat it was an active restraining order with the \nbeing the restrained person and the \n \nbeing the protected person.  \n \nSo, at that point, the assumption was that \n was not supposed to be there, but \n had \nbeen living there with the \n So she had gone, made contact at the door, tried to \nfind out if \n, basically checking the well-being \n, asked if \n was \nthere. \nseemed to be kind of evasive with her is what she told me….  \n \nMS: \n \nUh huh.  \n \nJM: \n….and they didn’t want to allow them to come in and check on the \n and make \nsure \n was all right and there was some, there was some evasiveness there. The \n \ntried to shut the door on them, or something like that is, from what I remember. Angelica \nsaid that sh…..they went hands on. They basically detained \n. Oh, I think \n came \nout. \n was in the background, and she’s like \n And \n like “yeah.” So \nshe’s like, I have a violation in progress of the restraining order ‘cause \nnot supposed \nto be there, was her assumption, so they detained \n, they detained \n. \n gets \ndetained for 148 basically for getting in the way ‘cause \n not letting them come in the \nhouse. \n said \n detains \n puts \n in cuffs, puts \n on the couch. They detained \n23-63: Jaime Miranda Interview \n(September 19, 2023) \n \n \n3 of 8 \nthe \n, put \n in cuffs, they sit \n on the front porch. She starts to try to figure \nout what’s going on exactly um, and that’s when she asked for a Sam unit.  \n \nFrom what I remember when I got there, I think she already had uncuffed the \n The \n had kind of calmed down. \n was crying and stuff, but \n had calmed down, so \nthey had removed the cuffs from \n Um, so I got there. The \n trying to explain to \nme that this restraining order like went away, like it had been done and over with. And I \nlooked at the CAD notes and I saw no, the restraining order’s there. It shows that it’s \nvalid. Um, so at that point, the assumption was we did have a violation of a restraining \norder. So we had asked the \n “is it okay if we just go check on your \n” \n \ngoes “I don’t know if she’s her or not.” Uh well “is it okay if we go up and check and, \nand you can come with us.” So \n says “yeah.”  \n \nSo \n escorts us upstairs, we go check the \n room, \n not there. So we \nasked \n “can you get ahold of \n by phone so we can talk to \n and find out if \n \nokay?” \n able to get ahold of \n We talked to \n over the phone. \n says “hey, \nI'm right here across the street with my \n.” So at that point, we go out, made \ncontact, and it was me and Officer Franco that went out. Officer Franco interviewed \n. \n basically explained to him the story of what happened, that \n had disclosed this to \n. \n was aware that there was a restraining order but \n didn’t know what \nhad happened with the restraining order, \n had just mentioned it to \n and \nthen that’s what got this whole thing going, right? The whole call for service getting \ngenerated.  \n \nSo, as we’re talking about it, um the \n kept talking about how \n didn’t remember \nthere ever be….or \n believed that there was a modification made to the restraining \norder that allowed \n to, it wasn’t a move-out order, it was just, \n couldn’t harass \n, \nstuff like that. So, we start reading through the restraining order that was put on the CAD \nnotes. As I'm reading through it, I, I don’t see anything about a move-out order, stay \naway order, there was nothing like that; it was just “do not harass, annoy, abuse, assault” \nwhatever. So basically it was like \n they can live together, but \n has to just leave \n \nalone.  \n \nSo once we figured all that out, I called Scott Aaron just to run the whole thing by him. \nActually I take that back. I think it was before I even figured out that there was no stay-\nout order or move-out order, I had called Scott Aaron and had explained to him what was \ngoing on, and the consensus was that we were just going to document this. If \n has \nbeen living there for months, and \n been fine, if \n could just go stay with \nsomebody in the meantime while \n goes and tries to get an emergency court hearing \nso they can modify this uh, restraining order to allow them to live together, then we were \ngoing to do that.  \n \nSo th…uh, the \n was like yeah, “I've been liv… on….on and off with my \n I can go stay with my \n.” So like everybody was okay with that; \n \nwas okay with that, \n move in with the \n and that was pretty much the end of \n23-63: Jaime Miranda Interview \n(September 19, 2023) \n \n \n4 of 8 \nit. That’s when we went back to explain to \n this is what we’re probably going to do. \nWe’re going to have your \n stay with \n. In the meantime, you need to go \nback to court and the \n kept saying “I don’t know. I don’t have a copy of it. I can't \nfind it, but I know there was a modification made to it.” That’s when I started reading \nthrough it and I saw there was no stay-out, or move-out order or stay-away order. So I \nwas like uh, okay, I think, I don’t think there’s a violation here because he should, there’s \nnothing says that they can't live together on the restraining order.  \n \nSo once we determine all of that stuff, then the decision was made, okay we’re just going \nto document it. We still explain to \n like “you still need to go to the courthouse and \nget clarification and verify that it’s okay for \n to be living with \n…. \n \nMS: \n \nUh huh.  \n \nJM: \n“……with this restraining order being in place um, and if you want to have \n \n stay so there’s no more problems tonight, if you want to have \n stay with \n then \n can go stay with \n.” So that was basically the end of it. They \nwere upset um, they were sub…..upset about, obviously \n got handcuffed and \neverything. Uh, Angelica had told \n initially like \n was going to arrest her for 148, \nand \n kept not letting \n in the house and that’s the only reason why Angelica told \nme she cuffed \n um and \n detained \n for 148 at that point. Um, but that was the \nend of it.  \n \nSo ultimately, once we figured out that there was no actual violation of the restraining \norder, it was more like cool, let’s just document. We’ll just document, we’ll cross, cross \nreport it to \n so they know what’s going on. \n, we advised \n you need to go back \nto court, get clarification on this restraining order, and then that’s pretty much going to be \nthe end of it. So, ultimately that’s how it ended. Um, we didn’t end up doing anything \nwith \n I think we just uncuffed \n and let \n go. Um, but again he had been \ndetained or….originally because they believed \n was vi…\n was actively violating the \nrestraining order. So…. \n \nMS: \n \nOkay.  \n \nJM: \n \n…that was pretty much the gist of the call and what happened.  \n \nMS: \nSo in the protective order, um you, you noticed that it, it, its had no, no harass, no, no, \nyou know, whatever, sexual assault…. \n \nJM: \nRight.  \n \nMS: \n…..everything else. Uh, but they did say in the stay order that they can actually \ncommunicate with one another?  \n \n23-63: Jaime Miranda Interview \n(September 19, 2023) \n \n \n5 of 8 \nJM: \nIt, it did, like specific….I don’t remember it stating that, but at, it was basic….it just said \nthat \n couldn’t basically annoy or harass \n and all that. So, it sounded to me, from \nreading it, it sounded like they were okay to be around each other…. \n \nMS: \nRight.  \n \nJM: \n….as long as \nwas \n was not messing with \n or giving \n a hard time, yelling at \n \nwhatever the case may be. \n just, \n had to be nice to \n basically according to the \nrestraining order. But I didn’t see anywhere in there that said that \n couldn’t be around \n that \n had to move out of the house, I didn’t see nothing like that. And that was, \nonce we realized that, we’re like, well we don’t even had a violation at this point; we \ndon’t have anything.  \n \nMS: \nAnd this wasn’t until, at the end when you were talking to \n, when you were trying to \nget everything clarified, and the \n told you that, like hey there’s, there was a, a \nclarification on this restraining order.  \n \nJM: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nAnd that’s when you read through it again and noticed that….(unintelligible).  \n \nJM: \n‘Cause \n kept trying to pull up emails that \n had on \n phone. \n goes “I know \nthere was a modification, there was m….there was amendment done to it…” \n kept \ntrying to explain it to me. It didn’t make sense, what \n was explaining….  \n \nMS: \nUh huh.  \n \nJM: \n…..and I’m like well we only have, there’s only one restraining order on file. \n kept \nsaying “there’s a new one. There’s a new one on….” and there’s one on file, it’s from \nlike 2020, and it’s still valid. So, we went back and forth with this thing. So finally I just \nstarted reading the whole thing line by line. As I'm reading it line by line, that’s when I \nrealized I don’t see anything about a stay-away order or a move-out order. So then I'm \nlike, that’s when I told Angelica “hey, I don’t, I don’t think we have a violation at this \npoint, ‘cause there’s nothing that says that \n can't, \n can't uh, or \n can't live \nthere.” So I think, and then that’s, that, \n like “yeah,” that’s what I, I knew there \nwas some kind of like specifics about it, but \n couldn’t say for sure.  \n \nMS: \nUh huh. \n \nJM: \nSo, that was already after everybody, everything had happened. I already had talked to \nScott Aaron, every….like basically everything had settled down. We were just going to \nhave \n go stay with \n…. \n \nMS: \nUh huh.  \n \n23-63: Jaime Miranda Interview \n(September 19, 2023) \n \n \n6 of 8 \nJM: \n….and we were going to, we were going to cite \n for the violation of restraining order. \nBut that’s when I, when I'm explaining all to \n, \n keeps talking about this \namendment, amendment, and that’s when I start reading it, and I realize there’s no stay-\naway order. So I'm like, we don’t have anything. So, at that point, I was like we, we can't \ntake any kind of arrest action at, that point, we’re just going to document it.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. So, in summary, Angelica gets dispatched to this check-the-well-being call. Um, \nduring the middle of it, \nasked for a Sam unit…. \n \nJM: \nRight.  \n \nMS: \n…and you arrive. You guys have a private conversation. She tells you that uh, \n is \noutside, that there’s a restraining order against the \n, and that \n trying to check-the-\nwell-being of the victim in this case; I guess it’s uh…. \n \nJM: \nLike a\n  \n \nMS: \n….uh, it’s a \n um let me see (unintelligible), \n…. \n \nJM: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \n….\n \n. So \n and \n need…\n wanted to check on her well-\nbeing, but the \n was prohibiting \n from, from going to go check on \n well-being. \n \nJM: \nUh huh.  \n \nMS: \nUm, during this time, Angelica, you weren’t there at that time, but Angelica handcuffs \n sits \n down inside of the house, and that’s when you show up. When you come in \ninside of the house, \n was already handcuffed, or not.  \n \nJM: \n…I think \n already had uncuffed \n.  \n \nMS: \nUncuffed \n, but \n was inside of the house. \n \nJM: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nAnd then you asked for consent “hey, are you okay if we uh, if we go check on \n well-\nbeing?”  \n \nJM: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nYou guys did it, \n wasn’t there. You guys end up calling\n and then make contact \nwith \n and \n just explained to you what you explained to me…. \n \nJM: \nYeah.  \n23-63: Jaime Miranda Interview \n(September 19, 2023) \n \n \n7 of 8 \n \nMS: \n….and it wasn’t towards the end when\n was adamant that there was no violation…. \n \nJM: \nRight.  \n \nMS: \n…that you read through it carefully, and you noticed that there wasn’t any violation and \nyou guys just decided to document everything…. \n \nJM: \nCorrect.  \n \nMS: \n….and everybody went on their way.  \n \nJM: \nThat’s correct.  \n \nMS: \nSo, the, the \n stayed, \n stayed, and the \n \n, went with \n.  \n \nJM: \n(inaudible), yeah.  \n \nMS: \nOkay. Um, did you speak to anybody else for this call for service?  \n \nJM: \nUh not….not, not really like directly. Uh, an \n and \nshowed up while we were \nthere. They got kind of animated. They were kind of trying to interject themselves. I \nheard….when I was upstairs, ‘cause uh, when Angelica basically uh, I'm sorry, not \nAngelica. I'm sorry, what’s the \nname? \n?  \n \nMS: \n \n.  \n \nJM: \nWhen \n wanted to go, well we decided \n was going to go to \n like \n“can I grab a few things from my room?” So I went upstairs with \n to grab \n \nbelongings.  \n \nMS: \nUh huh.  \n \nJM: \nUm, while \n grabbing her belongings, I hear some kind of argument at the front door. \nBasically the, the \n showed up, they were trying to force their way in the \nhouse and kind of interject themselves. So Eddie was bas…..telling them “hey, just hold \non. We’re just trying to get, have the \n grab \n s…belongings so we can get out of \nhere and then you guys can come in and whatever.” Um, so there was some kind of like \nbickering. So we go downstairs, and they’re all irate and they're pissed off because \nthey're like saying that there’s no restraining order, there’s no this, there’s no….they’re \narguing everything, they say we’re doing everything wrong. Um, so uh we basically tried \nto explain to them “look, we’ve already worked this all out with the \n but you guys \nhave no involvement in this. We’re going to deal with it,” so I, I heard Eddie explain all \nthat to them. When we went out, we’re waiting for \n uh the \n stood by while \n23-63: Jaime Miranda Interview \n(September 19, 2023) \n \n \n8 of 8 \nwe waited for the, but I didn’t have an….really any interact….\n was just like, \nwas \njust quiet; \n did say much to me. So…. \n \nMS: \nOkay. Uh, do you have anything else to add to the interview that I did not cover or that \nyou think is important for me to know?  \n \nJM: \nNo, th…I mean that’s pretty much the gist of it. Um, I could tell the family was upset \nabout what happened. I knew they were probably going to complain, so I immediately \ncame back to the station to brief Rocky on it…. \n \nMS: \nUh huh.  \n \nJM: \n….uh so I just gave him a whole rundown on everything that happened right after that \nhappened just in case it, they were probably going to call and complain. Um, so I gave \nhim basic…the, the rundown, wh…what occurred, what we had done, and everything like \nthat so…. \n \nMS: \nOkay. Um, so after you leave this interview, should you recall anything that is different \nfrom the information you provided today, you are now ordered to provide that \ninformation to me as soon as possible.  \n \nJM: \nOkay.  \n \nMS: \nYou understand that?  \n \nJM: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nI am ordering you not to discuss any portion of this investigation with any other \ndepartment employee other than me. If the subject officer of this investigation contacts \nyou, advise her you are not able to speak with them and contact me immediately. Do you \nunderstand?  \n \nJM: \nYeah.  \n \nMS: \nUm, all right. This concludes my uh interview with uh Sergeant Jaime Miranda.

This interview is \nregarding a call for service where Officer Lidia Vazquez generated on July 18th, 2023, \nreference checking the well-being of \n \n, who resides at \n \n \n \nDo you remember this call for service that was generated? \n \nSA:  \nYes.  \n \nMS:  \nTell me about that call for service from beginning to end.  \n \n23-63: Scott Aaron Interview \n(September 6, 2023) \n \n \n2 of 3 \nSA:  \nUh, I was working as a Supervisor for the Family Protection Unit. Um, I was notified by \nLidia Vazquez uh, that there was a \n referral that had come in from \n \n uh, regarding a \n, uh who had disclosed to \n that \n \nfound out that there was a restraining order against \n, um, and that there had \nbeen a prior history of sexual abuse um, and the \nr may uh, or may not be letting \nthe, uh, the suspect in that referral uh, live at the residence. Um, Lidia asked me uh, about \nthat and uh, because there was vague information there was no clear indication whether \nthere was a, a restraining order violation or not.  \n \nUh, I told Lidia to uh, contact Dispatch and have a patrol officer respond uh, determine \nwhat, what the circumstances are. Um, at that point, um, I didn’t hear anything back, uh \nfrom that. Uh, after the call for service was placed, um, I did receive later on in the \nevening a call from Jaime, uh, Miranda, who was the sergeant, or acting sergeant at the \ntime, I can’t remember which it was, uh, where he told me that um, there were some \nissues with the restraining order um, and forgive me that, but thi…this is not documented, \nthis is a, a phone call that like I frequently get um, out of the blue where they’re asking \nme questions um, and I’m trying to help guide the patrol supervisor uh through, uh, \nthrough the call for service, uh, but there were some issues with the restraining order. \nUm, I suggested um, that uh, a citation may uh, be applicable since it wasn’t a domestic \nviolence restraining order and it was more of a civil, or a, a civil or criminal protective \norder, I can’t remember which it was at this point. Um, so it, I had given him options on \nuh, dispositions and told him that he could possibly cite the \n out um, and after that uh, \nwe hung up and uh, I didn’t get a call back. I didn’t hear anything uh back on this uh, this \nissue, um until uh, it came across my desk coming over here to uh Professional \nStandards.  \n \nMS:  \nOkay. Did uh, detective, or actually Sergeant Miranda, uh tell you anything about the \nentry?  \n \nSA:  \nI, no, there was nothing about an entry.  \n \nMS:  \nOkay. Uh, did you speak to anyone else besides Lidia or uh Sergeant Jaime Miranda… \n \nSA:  \nNo. \n \nMS:  \n…about this case? Uh, do you have anything else to add to the interview that I did not \ncover or do you think is important for me to know? \n \nSA:  \nOnly that uh, I didn’t I,… as I…I directed Lidia to make the phone call. Um, I didn’t uh, \ndive into and directly tell her to um, uh, check for the restraining order or, or verify the \nvalidity. I just had her create a call for service…  \n \nMS:  \nCopy that.  \n \nSA:  \n…so. \n23-63: Scott Aaron Interview \n(September 6, 2023) \n \n \n3 of 3 \n \nMS:  \nAfter you, after you leave this interview, should you recall anything that is different from \nthe information you provided today, you are ordered to provide that information to me as \nsoon as possible.

Uh, on that particular date I was still working for the Family Protection Unit. Um, \nI was tasked with working the \n referrals that were coming in. I came across a \n \nreferral involving um, all three of these individuals, um where it stated the victim \nand….uh \n had been sexually assaulted by \n and that there was an actual uh \nrestraining order against \n. Um, there was also in the narrative uh a mention of \n living with them. Um, \n having allowed him to live there for quite some time \nnow um, and that’s why I generated that uh call for service.  \n \nMG:  \nOkay. So, when you say that that information that you got, how did you get that \ninformation? Did somebody call you? Or was it on a… \n \nLV:  \n…it was on a \n referral…..  \n \nMG:  \nOn a \n referral? \n \nLV:  \n…that was sent to the Family Protection Unit so I was working that queue.  \n \nMG:  \nOkay. Got it.

Um, once you pl….once you placed that 911 call and you generated the call for \nservice, uh, did any of the officers that responded to the residence contact you? \n \nLV:  \nYes.  \n \nMG:  \nUh, how did they contact you? And, and tell me about that.  \n \nLV:  \nUm, I was con...I don’t remember the exact time, but um, Officer Angelica Duran \ncontacted me via telephone.  \n \nMG:  \nOkay.  \n \nLV:  \n…um, to ask me about the call. She, through what I gathered from the notes that she was \nreading, it was very vague. So, I explained to her, hey I received a \n referral. This is \nwhat the \n referral states, and that’s why I generated the check the well-being ‘cause \n not supposed to be living in the home per the restraining order. At least, that’s \nwhat I had gathered from the \n referral um and I had told her that I double checked \nwith uh Records to make sure that the restraining order was still there and they confirmed \nit.  \n \nMG:  \nOkay, so per the referral, \n wasn’t supposed to be there? And then per Records, it \nwas just an active you know court order restraining order… \n \nLV:  \nCorrect.  \n \nMG:  \n…with no conditions? \n \nLV:  \nCorrect. So in the referral, it stated that the victim had disclosed to whoever the reporting \nparty was that there was a restraining order for \n. I don’t believe it specifically \nmentioned that \nwas not supposed to be living there but, based on my training and \nexperience, I know that restraining orders are usually to prevent suspects from coming in \ncontact with whoever the protected person is.  \n \nMG:  \nOkay.  \n \nLV:  \nSo, that’s where I gathered \n not supposed to be there.  \n \nMG:  \nUh, so tell me more about the uh contact with Angelica.  \n \nLV:  \nUh, that was, uh so that was our first contact. I basically gave her the rundown of what I \nread in the \n referral, the call that I generated and that I checked with Records, and \n23-63: Lidia Vazquez Interview \n(August 30, 2023) \n \n \n5 of 6 \nthat was it. Then I received another call from her at, I want to say it was closer to 7:00 or \n8:00 P.M... \n \nMG: \nMmhm. \n \nLV:  \n…um, with the outcome of what, basically the outcome of the call.  \n \nMG:  \nGot it. What’d she say? Tell me about that.  \n \nLV:  \nShe explained to me that um it, the restraining order actually didn’t have any stipulations \non it. Um, so initially when they were working the call, um, they also were under the \nimpression that\n was not supposed to be in the residence…. \n \nMG: \n \n(inaudible). \n \nLV:  \n \n…because there’s a active restraining order…  \n \nMG:   \nOkay.  \n \nLV:  \n…and once…I don’t know how their investigation evolved or anything but they ended up \nfinding out that there was, the stipulations had been removed. Uh, I guess they uh victim \n had gone to court or \n or something of that sort and they agreed that it \nwas fine with \n living there so that stipulation had been removed um which, that \nwas not....I, I didn’t ask about that, I didn’t know about that, and I, I don’t think Records \nhad anything in the system about that either.  \n \nMG:  \nOkay. Umm, do you have anything else to add to this interview that I did not cover or do \nyou think is important for me to know? \n \nLV:  \nNo. \n \nMG:  \nOkay. After you leave this interview, should you recall anything that is different from the \ninformation you provided today, you are ordered to provide that information to me as \nsoon as possible. Do you understand that Lidia? \n \nLV:  \nYes.  \n \nMG:  \nUh, I am now ordering you not to discuss any portion of this investigation with any other \nuh department employee other than me. If the subject officer of this investigation contacts \nyou, advise him or her you are not able to speak with them and contact me immediately \nof what occurred. Do you understand that Lidia? \n \nLV:  \nYes. \n \n23-63: Lidia Vazquez Interview \n(August 30, 2023) \n \n \n6 of 6 \nMG:  \nOkay. Uh, so it’s about 1125 hours and I'm concluding and finishing uh my interview \nwith Officer Lidia Vazquez. Thank you, Lidia.  \n \n \n \n**** \n \n(End of recording) \n \n \nDate:  \nJuly 20, 2023 \n \nTo: \nRocky Marquez, Commander  \n \nFrom: \nThomas Rawlings, Sergeant \n \n \nSubject: \nCall for service 23-51337 \n \n \nOn 7/18/203, at approximately 17:13 hours, officers were dispatched to \n \n \n \n to check the well-being of \n \n \n \n had revealed to \n \ntherapist that \nhad discovered that there was a restraining order against \n \n \n \n \n and \n was the protected person. The \n made a report with \n as a mandated reporter. \nThe Family Protective Unit received the report and generated a call for service.  \n \nOfficer Eduardo Hernandez, Officer Angelica Duran, and Officer Edgar Franco \nresponded to the residence. The call narrative notes stated to check the well-being of a \n living at this location. The notes stated that the \n had a restraining order \nagainst \n. The notes also stated to call Officer L. Vasquez for more details. The \ncall notes stated that \n was clear with a served criminal order and the protected \nperson was \n. The criminal protective order was also added to the call notes. The \ncriminal protective order does not have stay away terms for \n and \n. \n \nI reviewed the call for service, body worn camera footage of the incident, and incident \nreport. The following is a summary of the incident. \n \nOfficer Duran contacted Officer L. Vasquez who generated the call for service. Officer \nVasquez informed Officer Duran that a report had been made to \n \n. The report stated that \n \n was the protected person in a criminal \nprotective order and the restrained party in the criminal protective order was her \n \n \n. The criminal protective order was a result of an allegation of \n \n \nOfficer Duran, Officer Franco, and Officer Hernandez respond to the location and when \nthey knock on the door a female who identifies herself as a \n answers the door. \nOfficer Duran asks if \n is home and \n goes into the house to check and \nreturns and states that \n is not home. \n identifies herself as \n’s \n and asks the officers what is going on. The officers are vague about the reason \nthey responded to the residence. \n states that \n does not want to answer any \n       \n \n \n \nPolice Department \nJason Benites, Chief of Police \n23-51337 Memo \nJune 20, 2023 \n2 \n \nquestions and the contact becomes verbally confrontational.  A \n subject exits the \nresidence and \n identifies himself as \n \n. \n is detained in \nhandcuffs outside of the residence but is advised\n is not under arrest and only \ndetained. \n who is later identified as \n \n \n goes back into the \nresidence. As the door starts to close, Officer Duran pushes the front door open. Officer \nDuran advises \n \n that she needs to check for \n. \n \ntells Officer Duran that she does not have permission to enter \n residence and asks if \nshe has a warrant. Officer Duran tells \n that if \n refuses to comply with officers \norders \nwill be arrested for interfering with a police investigation. Officer Duran asks \n \n if \n is refusing to comply with a lawful order and \n responds \nyes. Officer Duran makes entry into the residence to affect a misdemeanor arrest. \nOfficer Duran handcuffs \n \n and brings \nback outside of the residence \nand request a supervisor respond to the scene. Officer Franco steps into the residence.  \n \nOfficer Duran asks \n \n if \n would prefer to go inside and \n \n stated that \n would like to go inside. Officer Duran reads \n her \nMiranda rights and begins speaking with \n Officer Duran removes the handcuffs from \n and continues her investigation. Sergeant Miranda arrives on scene and \n leads officers to \n’s room. It is discovered that \n is not at the \nresidence. Officers read the criminal protective order and see that it does not have stay \naway orders for \n \n and \n \n. Officers make contact with \n \nwho was staying at \n house.  After determining that \n did not need \npolice assistance at this time, officers and \n make arrangements for \n to stay at \nher \n residence.  \n \nAfter reviewing the incident, the following issues were identified: \n The criminal protective order was not reviewed thoroughly enough to see that it \ndid not contain a stay away order for \n and \n.  \n When the call for service was generated, it should have contained a comment \nthat the criminal protective order did not contain a stay away order.  \n During the initial incident, Officer Duran was the primary contact officer despite \nhaving a trainee who was in the advanced stages of the Field Training Program.  \n During the incident, \n \n exits the residence, and the facts don’t \nsupport that a warrantless entry into the residence under the exigency exemption \nis proper.  \n A detention in handcuffs or de facto arrest for refusing to allow a search of the \nresidence does not appear to be proper.  \n \n \nCHILD(RENS) NAME (S)\nOffenses\nTotal: 3.000\nCase Assignments:\nAssigned Officer\nAssignment Date/Time\nAssignment Type\nAssigned By Officer\nDue Date/Time\nAssociated Cases\nStatus\nAssisting ORIs\nRole\nModus Operandi\nSolvability Factors\nWeight\n19 - DIGITAL RECORDING\n1.000\n01 - DETECTIVE FOLLOW-UP NEEDED\n1.000\n14 - SUSPECT: NAMED\n1.000\nNo.\nGroup/ORI\nCrime Code\nStatute\nDescription\nCounts\n1\nCA0560400\n90Y  \nSUSPICIOUS \nCIRCUMSTANCE\nSUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE\n1\nOXNARD,CA\n08/14/2023\n07/19/2023\nSUSPENDED\nCLOSED\nFAMILY \nPROTECTION\n5431-Duran\n07/18/2023 17:13\n07/18/2023 17:13\n \nDisposition Date:\nStatus Date:\nDisposition:\nStatus:\nAssigned Bureau:\nro\nReporting Officer ID:\nOccured Thru:\nOccured From:\nIncident Type:\nLocation:\nCase Number:\n2023-00051337\nCase Details:\nReported Date:\n07/18/2023 17:13 Tuesday\nPage: 1 of 5\nCase Number:\n2023-00051337\nPrint Date/Time:\nLogin ID:\nOxnard Police Department\nOxnard Police Department\nDetail\n08/23/2023 12:03\nps\\miguel.serrato\nORI Number:\nCA0560400\nSubjects\nPrecipitating Event:\nAggravated Assault/ Homicide \nCircumstances #1: \nStatute: \nCounterfeit Amount: \nCounterfeit Status: \nCounterfeit Type: \nDirection of Travel: \nHow Left Scene: \nPoint of Exit: \nMethod of Exit : \nMethod of Exit Type: \n# of Premises Entered : \nMethod of Entry : \nMethod of Entry Type: \nPoint of Entry: \nJustifiable Homicide Code \n: \nAggravated Assault/ \nHomicide Remarks #2: \nAggravated Assault/ \nHomicide Remarks #1: \nAggravated Assault/ Homicide \nCircumstances #2: \nJustifiable Homicide \nCircumstances : \nComputer: \nDrugs: \nAlcohol: \nVictim Suspected of Using\nNo\nComputer: \nNo\nDrugs: \nNo\nAlcohol: \nOffender Suspected of Using\nLarceny Type: \nSpecial Circumstances: \nAnit-reproductive rights crime: \nPrior Inv - Offender: \nPrior Inv - Victim: \nOrder of Protection: \nPremise Code: \nHate Bias Indicator: \nAccosting Situation: \nDomestic Circumstance: \nProperty Damage Amt.: \n# of Adults: \nGang Related: \nArson Code: \nOffense Status: \nCarjacking: \nAbandoned Structure: \n# of Juveniles: \nAiding/Abetting: \nDomestic Code: \nStatus Date: \nHousehold Status: \n1\nIBR Seq.

We were \ndispatched to a welfare check and possible court order violation at \n in the \ncity of Oxnard, county of Ventura. \nDispatch provided that the female was identified as \n who had \na restraining order against \n and the \n of \n \nhas been letting the suspect stay at the residence periodically. The \n was identified as \n Dispatch further advised to contact the reporting party \nwho was an officer at the Oxnard Police Department. \nI then made phone contact with Officer Lidia Vazquez, who advised a \n \n referral was received with the Family Protection Unit in reference to conducting a \nwelfare check. Officer Vazquez provided that a \n of \n had relayed that during a \nsession, \n notified her that there was a court order preventing \n \nfrom being at the residence \n currently resides at with \n, \n Lidia \nstated the courts had issued a protective order due to allegations of \n. After being \nnotified of the circumstances by the \n referral, she called the Oxnard Police Dispatch Center \nto have officers conduct a welfare check. \nUpon arrival, myself, Officer Franco, along with assisting Officer Ed Hernandez, arrived on \nscene. As we knocked at the residence front door, a female opened the door and we notified \nher we were responding to a welfare check and needed to speak with \n The female \nstated \n was possibly inside the residence and proceeded to enter inside the residence \nand close the door behind her. The front door opened and \n arrived and stated that \n was no longer at the residence. At this point in time, \n confirmed to be the \n \nto \n stated she was not aware of what was going on and did not want to answer \nofficers’ questions. \nAt this point, we advised \n that officers were going to conduct a welfare check of the \nchildren and conduct a safety sweep to verify that \nwas not in need of police assistance \ninside the residence. \n indicated that she was not going to allow entry to officers as she \nclosed the front door. The entry door opened, and there was a \n subject who later found to \nbe \n. At this point, Officer Hernandez assisted by detaining \n, as I advised \n that we needed to go inside the residence to check the residence. \n stated that she was not going to allow any officers inside the residence as she stood in \nfront of the entry door. I advised her that she was delaying officers from conducting their lawful \nduties in conducting a welfare check of \n and any minor children and was liable for arrest \nof penal code 148. \n again stated that she was not going to allow officers inside and was \nnot going to answer any further questions. I asked her again if she was going to refuse a lawful \n2023-00051337\n07/18/2023\n5431 Duran\nCase 2023-00051337 Page 3 OF 5\norder, to which she stated yes. At this point I put her in handcuffs. \n then proceeded to \nadvise me to contact her \n identified as \n with a phone number of \n \n, to respond for \n at the residence. A safety sweep was conducted with \nmyself and Officer Franco of the residence and learned that \n was not present at the \nresidence and the \n were present upstairs. \nAs emotions were de-escalating, I asked \n if she'd be willing to speak to me inside the \nresidence away from \n to which she stated yes. As \n was calming down, I released \nthe handcuffs and read her the Miranda rights utilizing my department-issued Miranda card. I \nasked \n if she had any idea why officers were present at the residence, and she stated \nyes. She indicated something to the effect of having an argument with her daughter \n \nand that \n was having another tantrum to the level of having law enforcement respond. \n provided that she was, in fact, aware of a criminal protective order that was valid by the \nVentura County Superior Court (reference court case number \n) which was issued \nby Ventura County Superior Court on February 1, 2021 with an expiration date of February 1, \n2024 which was served in court. In the order, \n was named as the restrained \nparty and \n as the protected party. \n provided that as far as she was aware, \nshe had requested to remove the stay away order on the court issued order. She stated as far \nas she was aware, the court order was dropped. \nWe asked if she had any proof or any hard copy of the court order, to which she stated \npossibly on her cell phone. Officers had requested a supervisor on scene to assist with the \ninvestigation. Sergeant Miranda arrived and was updated on the circumstances. While I was \nspeaking with \n and Sergeant Miranda present, it was learned that an amended court \norder was possibly done by the courts. My partner, Officer Franco, was tasked with making \nphone contact with \n For further to his contact with \n refer to his case \nsupplement report under this case number. \nAfter learning of the circumstances of the court order and the amended order, we advised \n to assist in preventing another incident of this nature, to have a hard copy and seek \nclarification by the courts since she had relayed that \n had agreed to remove the stay \naway term condition. \n further added that \n has been at the residence with \n \nwith no issues or complaints. \n was advised that the entire incident was going to be \ndocumented and \n was going to be informed of our findings as they \nwere the referring agency. \nOfficer Hernandez advised that \n did not wish to speak on the matter and \nremained quiet during his initial contact. After learning of the circumstances, I made contact \nwith \n and advised that the criminal protective order was still effective and no stay away \norder was in place at this time. I advised him that the entire contact of today’s incident would \nbe documented and submitted for review. A business card was provided for \n with this \n2023-00051337\n07/18/2023\n5431 Duran\nCase 2023-00051337 Page 4 OF 5\ncase report number. \nOfficer Franco and Sergeant Miranda were able to make physical contact with \n who \nadvised \n wished to collect some items from the residence and would be able to stay with \nher \n \n.

This report was written \nto the best of my recollection and not a direct transcript of the video. All recordings were later \ndownloaded to the secure server at the AC Transit Police Services.\nOn 050323, I was working as a Deputy Sheriff assigned to the AC Transit Police Services. I was \nwearing my class \"D\" utility uniform, which displayed an Alameda County Sheriff`s Office patch on \neach shoulder and identified me as a Deputy Sheriff. I wore a Tactical Vest with a Sheriff`s Office gold \nbadge patch on the upper left chest area, my name across the right chest area and the word \n\"SHERIFF\" in large gold lettering across the upper back. The Tactical Vest carried several items of \npolice equipment, which included my radio, handcuffs, flashlight, expandable baton, and my Taser 7 \n(serial # \n). I was driving in a fully marked patrol vehicle (#3643).\nAbout 0419 hours, Deputy M. Ella and I were detailed to the San Leandro BART Station, located at \n1401 San Leandro Boulevard in San Leandro for a report of a suspicious person onboard AC Transit \nCoach 2317. Sheriff’s Dispatch advised a male, later identified as, \n \n was on the coach, \nsitting on the driver seat, and when confronted by staff, began to chase the employees threatening to \nassault the AC Transit Supervisor, \nWhile enroute, Sheriff’s Dispatch advised \n was becoming more agitated and was fighting with \nSupervisor \n in the BART Station parking lot. \n was described as a black male adult with \ndreadlocks wearing no shirt, black jacket, and ripped style black jeans.\nI arrived with Deputy Ella and saw \n near the coach platform walking toward our direction.

(E8631935) \n \n \nBACKGROUND: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nINVESTIGATION: \n \nOn 7/1/23 at approximately 1948 hours, Corporal Vicencio (0426) and I received a be on the lookout \n(BOL) of a stolen white 1997 Ford F150 (CA/\n) driving eastbound on Palomar Airport Road from \nMelrose Drive in Carlsbad. I was driving southbound on South Rancho Santa Fe Road and located a \nvehicle matching the description. The vehicle was crossing South Rancho Santa Fe Road traveling \neastbound on San Marcos Boulevard in the city of San Marcos within the county of San Diego.  \n \nI turned eastbound onto W San Marcos Boulevard, followed the vehicle, and confirmed the license plate \nas the stolen vehicle. Corporal Vicencio radioed the suspect vehicle's information and additional units \n(b)(6)(A)\n(b)(6)(C)\n(b)(6)(A)\n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nArrest/Juvenile Contact Report \n9 \nPage 9 of 11 \n \n \nCase No. 23127563 \nCAD Event No.: \nE8631935 \nCase Disposition: \nArrest \nPrimary Victim: \nDruda, Austin \nReport No. 23127563.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \nReviewed By \nSH0521 - BRAUER, ROBERT \nSan Marcos Station \nSAN MARCOS PATROL \nSH3925 - RODRIGUEZ, LUCIA \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \nReviewed Date \n7/1/2023 9:21:26 PM \nSH1131 - SANTOS JR, JAMES \n07/24/2023 00:10:29 \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH5865 \nPrinted: August 30, 2023 - 9:40 PM \n \n \nresponded to the area. Once additional units were in place, I attempted to initiate a high-risk traffic stop \nat the 800 block of W San Marcos Boulevard. The driver of the F150, later identified as Brent Ebert \npulled into the parking lot of the shopping center on the south side of W San Marcos Boulevard.  Ebert \nfailed to yield and sped out of the parking lot, driving over the curb and barely missing Corporal Buckley's \n(4063) patrol vehicle which was blocking the driveway to the parking lot. Ebert headed north on S Bent \nAve and turned eastbound onto W San Marcos Boulevard. Ebert entered the eastbound State Route 78 \nand exited at Twin Oaks Valley Road where he failed to stop for the red light and headed southbound on \nTwin Oaks Valley Road.  At Craven Drive, Ebert veered into the northbound lanes of South Twin Oaks \nValley Road and continued southbound until turning eastbound onto Village Drive. We terminated the \npursuit, turning off our overhead lights, following the vehicle at a safe distance.  Ebert was observed \nturning eastbound onto Wandering Way, southbound onto Savona Lane, eastbound onto Garland \nAvenue and finally northbound onto Custer Avenue. The vehicle pursuit lasted approximately 2.1 miles \nand approximately 3 minutes. Throughout the pursuit, Ebert drove at high rates of speed, up to 82 miles \nper hour on the freeway and 60 miles per hour on surface streets. Ebert made numerous unsafe lane \nchanges and drove on the wrong side of a divided roadway. \n \nAt the dead end of Custer Avenue, Ebert exited the vehicle and fled on foot. Since Ebert did not place \nthe vehicle's transmission into park, it rolled back into the lead patrol vehicle. The patrol vehicle suffered \nminor damage to the front end. Traffic Deputy, Corporal Guerrero (0817) investigated the collision (see \nCase #23177566 for details). \n \nDeputy Druda (0639) began a foot pursuit and followed Ebert who climbed the fence on the side of the \nhouse located 877 Custer Avenue. Deputy Druda went through the gate and as he attempted to \napprehend Ebert, a use of force ensued (see Deputy Druda's officer report). Corporal Maldonado came \nto assist Deputy Druda and was also involved in the use of force (see Corporal Maldonado's officer \nreport). Deputy Haggerty (4097) and Deputy Manibusan (0640) assisted detaining Ebert (see Deputy \nHaggerty's officer report and Deputy Manibusan's officer report). During the use of force, Deputy Druda \nsuffered redness and swelling to his left knee. Deputy Maldanado sustained redness and bruising to his \nright knee. Deputy Manibusan sustained scratches, redness, and minor bruising to his right forearm and \nwrist. Ebert suffered a laceration above his left eye, a fracture to his left cheek bone, an abrasion to his \nnose and two cuts to his right wrist. \n \n \nSan Marcos Fire Department Engine #141 and RA #141 responded to the scene and transported Ebert \nto Palomar Medical Center for evaluation. \n \nDeputy Druda contacted the register owner of the stolen vehicle and released the vehicle to the owner at \nthe scene. Deputy Druda contacted Stolen Vehicle System and removed the vehicle as stolen. A records \ncheck indicated the vehicle was stolen out of the city of San Diego on 06/17/2023. California Highway \nPatrol took the initial stolen vehicle report \n Deputy Salazar photographed the \nrecovered vehicle and of Deputy Druda and Deputy Manibusan.  \n \n(b)(6)(C)\n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nArrest/Juvenile Contact Report \n10 \nPage 10 of 11 \n \n \nCase No. 23127563 \nCAD Event No.: \nE8631935 \nCase Disposition: \nArrest \nPrimary Victim: \nDruda, Austin \nReport No. 23127563.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \nReviewed By \nSH0521 - BRAUER, ROBERT \nSan Marcos Station \nSAN MARCOS PATROL \nSH3925 - RODRIGUEZ, LUCIA \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \nReviewed Date \n7/1/2023 9:21:26 PM \nSH1131 - SANTOS JR, JAMES \n07/24/2023 00:10:29 \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH5865 \nPrinted: August 30, 2023 - 9:40 PM \n \n \nAt Palomar Medical Center, I admonished Ebert per my deputy notebook and Ebert provided the \nfollowing statement: \n \nSTATEMENTS: \n \nSTATEMENT OF BRENT EBERT: \n \nEbert said he got the vehicle from his friend \n, earlier today.

(E8631935) \n \n \nBACKGROUND: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nINVESTIGATION: \n \nOn 7/1/23 at approximately 1948 hours, Corporal Vicencio (0426) and I received a be on the lookout \n(BOL) of a stolen white 1997 Ford F150 (CA/\n) driving eastbound on Palomar Airport Road from \nMelrose Drive in Carlsbad. I was driving southbound on South Rancho Santa Fe Road and located a \nvehicle matching the description. The vehicle was crossing South Rancho Santa Fe Road traveling \neastbound on San Marcos Boulevard in the city of San Marcos within the county of San Diego.  \n \nI turned eastbound onto W San Marcos Boulevard, followed the vehicle, and confirmed the license plate \nas the stolen vehicle. Corporal Vicencio radioed the suspect vehicle's information and additional units \nresponded to the area. Once additional units were in place, I attempted to initiate a high-risk traffic stop \nat the 800 block of W San Marcos Boulevard. The driver of the F150, later identified as Brent Ebert \npulled into the parking lot of the shopping center on the south side of W San Marcos Boulevard.  Ebert \nfailed to yield and sped out of the parking lot, driving over the curb and barely missing Corporal Buckley's \n(4063) patrol vehicle which was blocking the driveway to the parking lot. Ebert headed north on S Bent \nAve and turned eastbound onto W San Marcos Boulevard. Ebert entered the eastbound State Route 78 \nand exited at Twin Oaks Valley Road where he failed to stop for the red light and headed southbound on \nTwin Oaks Valley Road.  At Craven Drive, Ebert veered into the northbound lanes of South Twin Oaks \nValley Road and continued southbound until turning eastbound onto Village Drive. We terminated the \npursuit, turning off our overhead lights, following the vehicle at a safe distance.  Ebert was observed \nturning eastbound onto Wandering Way, southbound onto Savona Lane, eastbound onto Garland \nAvenue and finally northbound onto Custer Avenue. The vehicle pursuit lasted approximately 2.1 miles \nand approximately 3 minutes. Throughout the pursuit, Ebert drove at high rates of speed, up to 82 miles \nper hour on the freeway and 60 miles per hour on surface streets. Ebert made numerous unsafe lane \nchanges and drove on the wrong side of a divided roadway. \n \n(b)(6)(A)\n(b)(6)(C)\n(b)(6)(A)\n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nPublic Records Request \nVictim Copy \n5 \nPage 5 of 6 \n \n \nCase No. 23127563 \nPrimary Victim: \nDruda, Austin \nReport No. 23127563.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \n \nSH0521 - BRAUER, ROBERT \nSan Marcos Station \nSAN MARCOS PATROL \n \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \n \n07/01/2023 21:21:26 \nSH1131 - SANTOS JR, JAMES \n \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH5865 \nPrinted: August 30, 2023 - 9:40 PM \n \n \nAt the dead end of Custer Avenue, Ebert exited the vehicle and fled on foot. Since Ebert did not place \nthe vehicle's transmission into park, it rolled back into the lead patrol vehicle. The patrol vehicle suffered \nminor damage to the front end. Traffic Deputy, Corporal Guerrero (0817) investigated the collision (see \nCase #23177566 for details). \n \nDeputy Druda (0639) began a foot pursuit and followed Ebert who climbed the fence on the side of the \nhouse located 877 Custer Avenue. Deputy Druda went through the gate and as he attempted to \napprehend Ebert, a use of force ensued (see Deputy Druda's officer report). Corporal Maldonado came \nto assist Deputy Druda and was also involved in the use of force (see Corporal Maldonado's officer \nreport). Deputy Haggerty (4097) and Deputy Manibusan (0640) assisted detaining Ebert (see Deputy \nHaggerty's officer report and Deputy Manibusan's officer report). During the use of force, Deputy Druda \nsuffered redness and swelling to his left knee. Deputy Maldanado sustained redness and bruising to his \nright knee. Deputy Manibusan sustained scratches, redness, and minor bruising to his right forearm and \nwrist. Ebert suffered a laceration above his left eye, a fracture to his left cheek bone, an abrasion to his \nnose and two cuts to his right wrist. \n \n \nSan Marcos Fire Department Engine #141 and RA #141 responded to the scene and transported Ebert \nto Palomar Medical Center for evaluation. \n \nDeputy Druda contacted the register owner of the stolen vehicle and released the vehicle to the owner at \nthe scene. Deputy Druda contacted Stolen Vehicle System and removed the vehicle as stolen. A records \ncheck indicated the vehicle was stolen out of the city of San Diego on 06/17/2023. California Highway \nPatrol took the initial stolen vehicle report \n. Deputy Salazar photographed the \nrecovered vehicle and of Deputy Druda and Deputy Manibusan.  \n \nAt Palomar Medical Center, I admonished Ebert per my deputy notebook and Ebert provided the \nfollowing statement: \n \nSTATEMENTS: \n \nSTATEMENT OF BRENT EBERT: \n \nEbert said he got the vehicle from his friend\n, earlier today. Ebert became uncooperative and did not \nprovide any further details. \n \n \nINVESTIGATION CONTINUED: \n \nEbert was medically cleared by the Palomar Medical Center staff. While at the hospital Deputy Vicencio \ntook photographs of Ebert.  \n \n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(C)\n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nPublic Records Request \nVictim Copy \n6 \nPage 6 of 6 \n \n \nCase No. 23127563 \nPrimary Victim: \nDruda, Austin \nReport No. 23127563.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \n \nSH0521 - BRAUER, ROBERT \nSan Marcos Station \nSAN MARCOS PATROL \n \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \n \n07/01/2023 21:21:26 \nSH1131 - SANTOS JR, JAMES \n \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH5865 \nPrinted: August 30, 2023 - 9:40 PM \n \n \nEbert was placed under arrest for 10851 (A) - VC - TAKE VEHICLE W/O OWNER'S \nCONSENT/VEHICLE THEFT (F), 69(A) - PC - OBSTRUCT/RESIST EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITH \nMINOR INJURY (F), 496 D (A) - PC - POSS STOLEN VEH/VESSEL (F), 12500 (A) - VC - DRVG \nWITHOUT VALID DRVR'S LIC (M), 2800.2 (A) - VC - EVADE PEACE OFCR WITH WANTON \nDISREGARD FOR SAFETY (F), 2800.4 - VC - EVADING A PEACE OFFICER:WRONG WAY DRIVER \n(F), and 12022.1 - PC - COMMIT FEL ON BAIL OR O/R RELEASE (BAIL+). \n \nEbert was transported to Vista Detention Facility (VDF) for booking. \n \nBody worn cameras documented the incident. \n \nEvidence:   \n \n1.

I \nobserved the suspect fall headfirst over the five-to-six-foot tall gate and briefly lost observation of him for about two to three \nseconds. Based off my training and experience, fleeing felons and vehicle thieves are known to carry firearms or deadly \nweapons, and will use physical force against law enforcement to avoid being arrested. I caught up to the wooden gate and \npushed it open and regained visual observation of the suspect. I observed the suspect roll onto his back and use his feet to \nkick me to prevent me from gaining control of him. I used my bodyweight to prevent him from continuing to kick at me and felt \nhim grab onto my gear near the right side of my waist where my firearm was holstered. I continued to yell \"Get on the fucking \nground\" as he pulled on me and attempted to stand up. He continued to grip onto my gear and pull me closer to his body. \n \nTo prevent the suspect from gaining control of me or any of my issued gear, to include a deadly weapon, I used a closed fist \nwith my right hand and punched the suspect in the face four to five times until I felt him release his hand from my gear. I \nattempted to gain control of the suspect's left arm with my hands to roll him onto his stomach and place him in handcuffs. The \nsuspect continued resist by interlocking his left hand to his right arm above his head. He asked, \"Why are you fucking \npunching me man\" and I stated, \"Because you're grabbing my fucking waist.\" He continued to grip onto his right arm with his \nleft hand and I used my left hand and punched him in the arm one time, which caused him to release his right arm and \nallowed me to gain complete control of his left arm. \n \nAdditional Deputies arrived to assist, and we were able to place him in handcuffs without further incident. The suspect was \nimmediately rolled into the recovery position and escorted to the street to be evaluated by paramedics. He was identified as \nBrent Ebert \n) by a Deputy on scene. Ebert has an extensive criminal history to include the following charges: \n \n.  \n \nForce was necessary to prevent Ebert from escape; self-defense; and to prevent him from possibly running into an occupied \nresidence or backyard which could have resulted in injury to innocent bystanders. Due to the time of day and warm summer \nweather, there was a likelihood that the residence had an open backdoor or window, which Ebert could have entered through. \nThe force used was effective and ultimately resulted in safely detaining him in handcuffs and preventing further injury to \nDeputies or bystanders.  \n \nDuring the physical altercation, I sustained a scuff with redness on my left knee, a scratch on my right elbow, and pain to my \nright hand.

WOODHAMS was \npreviously provided an Investigatory Interview Administrative Subject Memorandum (Exhibit 6) and \nwas read the Advisement of Rights – Administrative Investigation Form (Exhibit 7). The following is \nmy synopsis of the information provided during the interview: \n \nI had WOODHAMS review relevant policies from the Department Operations Manual \n(DOM 31010.1-Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, \nDOM 33030.3.1-Code of Conduct, DOM 33030.3.3-Law Enforcement \nCode of Ethics), as well as Title 15 from the California Code of Regulations (CCR § \n3391 Employee Conduct), which he said he was aware of (Exhibit 8). WOODHAMS \nconfirmed he was aware of the expectation of demonstrating honesty, cooperating fully \nwith an investigation, and providing truthful statements. \n \nWOODHAMS said he was hired as a correctional officer (CO) in December of 2013, \nand he has worked at SCC during his employment.

I observed the gate to be secured with a pad \nlock and steel cable lock that was not wide enough for me to access. Deputy Peratis informed me that \nSteve was in violation of a temporary restraining order. I asked Deputy Peratis to meet me by the \nsecured gate. \n \nWhile waiting for Deputy Peratis I continued to observe Steve make non-sensical statements and \nexaggerated hand gestures. Once Deputy Peratis arrived at my location, I asked her to retrieve a \nbreaching tool in order to access the gated area. I told Steve that he was in violation of a restraining \norder. I told Steve that he needed to listen to all my directions so that he, myself, and/or my partners \ndidn't get hurt. An unidentified subject was speaking to Steve whom he called \"primo.\" This subject told \nSteve that he wasn't allowed to be there and that he can't be home. Steve asked me if he could go back \nhome, and I told him \"no\".  \n \nSteve then got up and walked towards the fence and looked back at me. I yelled \"Steve, don't do it. Do \nnot do it, I promise I will chase you.\" I put out over the radio that I had one subject running northbound \ntowards Boll Weevil which initiated a \"Code 3\" response from my partners in the surrounding area. I \ndescribed the subject as a middle eastern male, shirtless, with black shorts and shoes. I lost visual on \nSteve and asked units to flood the area to check for him. All available Lakeside and Santee units \nresponded to assist with the call.   \n \nWhile several units checked the area, Deputy Peratis put out on the radio that she located the subject at \n9739 Winter Gardens Blvd #12. I ran over to assist Deputy Peratis and observed Steve at the top of the \nstairwell in front of #12 and the adjacent unit. The space Steve was standing in was approximately 4 ft X \n5 ft wide. Steve was standing at the top of the stairs and waiving a spatula that could potentially be used \nas blunt object type weapon. Due to the location where this was taking place, I called for a less lethal \nshotgun that was loaded with CTS 2581 Specialty Munitions (Super Sock) in case we needed it. \nDeputies are not trained to fight in stairwells and the situation presented high risk for both deputies and \nSteve who was being verbally non compliant. I decided against using my Conducted Electrical Device \n(CED) in fear that it would cause Steve's muscles to lock up at the top of the stairs and cause him to \npossibly fall face forward. Also decided not to deploy Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) spray due to the small \nworking space that it would easily affect deputies as much as Steve.  \n \nAt about 2049 hours, Sergeant Worthington (6928) arrived on scene near the bottom of the staircase and \nwas present while I gave Steve verbal commands. I told Steve that he needed to come down from the \nstair top, that I was with the Sheriff's Department and that he needed to come down. Steve ignored my \ncommands and assumed what I perceived as fighting stance by slighting blading his body at the top of \nthe stairs, balled up his fists, and flailed around aggressively. Steve continued to scream non sensical \nstatements. I told Steve he was under arrest, and he replied. \"Fuck you!\" I again told Steve that he was \nunder arrest and that I did not want him to get hurt. Steve ignored me. I asked Steve if there was \nanything I could do to gain his compliance and come down from the stairs.

Worthington (0363), and Deputy Michel \n(0548) were near me at the bottom of the staircase assisting me with the call. K9 Deputy Simpson (2597) \nand his K9 partner \"Maco\" also arrived on scene to act as a deterrent and was ready to deploy him if \nneeded. Sergeant Worthington told Steve to come down from the stairs with his hands up. Steve ignored \nthe commands from Sergeant Worthington. Deputy Michel told Steve to come downstairs, or force may \nbe used against him and for him to get on his stomach. Steve did not comply with Deputy Michel's \nwarning. Deputy Michel deployed four rounds of specialty munitions. Deputy Michel's first three rounds \nstruck Steve but appeared to have little effect. The 4th round struck Steve on his right inner thigh and \ncaused him to fall to the ground. (See Deputy Michel's Deputy Report for further detail). Had force not \nbeen used, deputies and Steve would have been placed in a high-risk environment likely to sustain an \ninjury due to the location being the top of the stairs had anyone fallen causing serious injury or possibly \ndeath.  \n \nUpon seeing Steve fall to the ground on his back, I ran up the stairs and attempted to restrain Steve. I \nused both of my hands to grab Steve's left arm and roll him to his stomach in the prone position. Steve \nignored my commands, tensed his arm and resisted my pull, but I was able to overcome his resistance \nand placed him on his stomach. Once Steve was placed on his stomach, another deputy secured his left \narm and I saw that Steve was attempting to use his legs to resist being placed flat on the ground. I used \nboth of my hands to grab Steve's legs and pulled them straight. I used downward pressure with both of \nmy hands on Steve's legs for approximately 1 minute in order to keep them in place while Deputy \nAddenbrooke and Deputy Peratis secured the rest of Steve's body placing his other arm behind his back. \nDeputy W. Worthington and Deputy Addenbrooke were able to secure Steve in handcuffs. (See Deputy \nPeratis, and Deputy Addenbrooke's Deputy's Report for further detail). Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy \nPeratis sat Steve up and assisted him to his feet. Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy Peratis escorted \nSteve out of the stairwell and began to walk him over to a marked patrol car. Had I not used force, Steve \nmay have continued to be uncooperative or attempted to continue to evade putting himself, the public, \nand deputies at risk of further injury while attempting to take Steve into custody during a high-risk \nincident.  \n \nWhile Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy Peratis were escorting Steve to a patrol car, I observed he \nbegan to drop his body weight, pulling away from them, and resisted being escorted. Deputy \nAddenbrooke and Deputy Peratis utilized a hammer lock technique on Steve in order to escort him safely \nand quickly to a nearby vehicle. Steve continued to resist by dropping his body weight. Deputies decided \nthat it would be safer to transport Steve by first placing him in a WRAP restraint. I observed Steve resist \nbeing placed on the ground by tensing his muscles and stiffening his legs. In order to get Steve on the \nground I placed my right leg in front of both of his and placed my right arm on his upper back and pushed \nhim forward. Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy Peratis were able to place Steve on the ground safely. \nHad I not used force to assist in bringing Steve to the ground he could have pulled Deputy Addenbrooke \nand Deputy Peratis to the ground causing them serious injury.  \n \nBefore being placed into the WRAP restraint, Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy Peratis conducted a \nsearch incident to arrest but did not locate anything illegal on Steve's person.

Had I not used downward pressure to secure Steve's legs, he could \nhave hit myself or my partners causing injury. While securing Steve's legs he was able to bump my \ncamera and shut it off just before the WRAP placement. Due to this occurring, my body camera did not \ncapture the WRAP placement and was reactivated when I noticed it was off after the WRAP placement.  \n \nDeputy Maxin secured the ankle restraint. Deputy Maxin, Deputy Paulino (0288), I secured the leg \nrestraint and straps. Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy Peratis applied the chest restraint with the \nassistance of Deputy Paulino securing the chest restraint to the leg restraint. I secured the chest restraint \ntighter when I observed it was loose. (See Deputy Maxin and Deputy Paulino's Deputy Reports for further \ndetail). Sergeant Worthington was present for the WRAP placement and acted as the safety officer. I had \nSteve seated in an upright position while we waited for the Lakeside Fire Department to arrive on scene.  \n \nWhile waiting for paramedics to arrive, Deputy Peratis spoke to the reporting party who was identified as \n who is Steve's \n and the listed protected party in two criminal protective orders where \nSteve is listed as the restrained party. Deputy Peratis obtained a statement from \n in reference to this \nincident and confirmed both the orders were valid and served with a stay away order listed on both (CPO \n#CE400307 and #C416038). \n is listed at the protected party on both CPO's. \n \nLakeside Fire Engine #2 and Lakeside Medic #2 arrived on scene to evaluate Steve. Lakeside Medics \nevaluated him and determined he was unable to orient himself and was unable to recall what year it was \nor how old he was. Lakeside Medics requested Steve be removed from the chest restraint and handcuffs \nin order to properly seat him onto the gurney and into the ambulance. I removed the chest restraint and \nhandcuffs, and Lakeside Medics secured him with soft restraints onto the gurney. Lakeside Medics then \nplaced Steve into the ambulance to be transported to UCSD Hospital. Before leaving to the hospital, \nLakeside Medics asked for my assistance in obtaining his blood sugar in order to properly treat Steve \nand he was refusing. I used downward pressure with both of my hands on Steve's right arm until \nLakeside medics were able to successfully obtain his blood sugar level.  \n \nI rode in the back of the ambulance while Deputy Peratis trailed behind in a patrol car.  While I was in the \nambulance, I took several photographs of Steve. I observed that Steve had four apparent contusions \nfrom the less lethal munitions impact on the following areas of his body: right inner thigh, left wrist, left \nforearm, and left abdomen. I also observed white foam around Steve's mouth, his blank stare, and his \nconstant asking for water. These are symptoms commonly seen with a person under the influence of a \ncontrolled substance.  \n \nLakeside paramedics arrived at UCSD hospital where Steve was transferred to a higher level of care. \nWhile at the hospital, medical staff informed me that Steve likely suffered a fractured left wrist and would \nneed to be placed in a cast. Steve was treated and cleared for jail placement. During the entire incident it \nwas apparent that Steve displayed several signs and symptoms of being under the influence of a \ncontrolled substance due to his erratic behavior, blank stare, non sensical statements, foaming of the \n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nArrest/Juvenile Contact Report \n10 \nPage 10 of 10 \n \n \nCase No. 23126779 \nCAD Event No.: \nE8620721 \nCase Disposition: \nArrest \nPrimary Victim: \nPeratis, A \nReport No. 23126779.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \nReviewed By \nSH3927 - TREVINO, GILBERT \nLakeside Substation \nLAKESIDE PATROL \nSH6928 - WORTHINGTON, JASON \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \nReviewed Date \n6/27/2023 12:05:20 AM \nSH1386 - TRIM, COLBY \n06/27/2023 23:59:15 \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH2304 \nPrinted: July 19, 2023 - 11:22 AM \n \n \nmouth, involuntary muscular movements, and his inability to follow basic commands, but I was unable to \ncomplete a further evaluation due to him being treated by paramedics.

Deputy Michel told Steve to come downstairs, or force may \nbe used against him and for him to get on his stomach. Steve did not comply with Deputy Michel's \nwarning. Deputy Michel deployed four rounds of specialty munitions. Deputy Michel's first three rounds \nstruck Steve but appeared to have little effect. The 4th round struck Steve on his right inner thigh and \ncaused him to fall to the ground. (See Deputy Michel's Deputy Report for further detail).

I \nused both of my hands to grab Steve's left arm and roll him to his stomach in the prone position. Steve \nignored my commands, tensed his arm and resisted my pull, but I was able to overcome his resistance \nand placed him on his stomach. Once Steve was placed on his stomach, another deputy secured his left \narm and I saw that Steve was attempting to use his legs to resist being placed flat on the ground. I used \nboth of my hands to grab Steve's legs and pulled them straight. I used downward pressure with both of \nmy hands on Steve's legs for approximately 1 minute in order to keep them in place while Deputy \nAddenbrooke and Deputy Peratis secured the rest of Steve's body placing his other arm behind his back. \nDeputy W. Worthington and Deputy Addenbrooke were able to secure Steve in handcuffs. (See Deputy \nPeratis, and Deputy Addenbrooke's Deputy's Report for further detail). Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy \nPeratis sat Steve up and assisted him to his feet. Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy Peratis escorted \nSteve out of the stairwell and began to walk him over to a marked patrol car. Had I not used force, Steve \nmay have continued to be uncooperative or attempted to continue to evade putting himself, the public, \nand deputies at risk of further injury while attempting to take Steve into custody during a high-risk \nincident.  \n \nWhile Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy Peratis were escorting Steve to a patrol car, I observed he \nbegan to drop his body weight, pulling away from them, and resisted being escorted. Deputy \nAddenbrooke and Deputy Peratis utilized a hammer lock technique on Steve in order to escort him safely \nand quickly to a nearby vehicle. Steve continued to resist by dropping his body weight. Deputies decided \nthat it would be safer to transport Steve by first placing him in a WRAP restraint. I observed Steve resist \nbeing placed on the ground by tensing his muscles and stiffening his legs. In order to get Steve on the \nground I placed my right leg in front of both of his and placed my right arm on his upper back and pushed \nhim forward. Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy Peratis were able to place Steve on the ground safely. \nHad I not used force to assist in bringing Steve to the ground he could have pulled Deputy Addenbrooke \nand Deputy Peratis to the ground causing them serious injury.  \n \nBefore being placed into the WRAP restraint, Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy Peratis conducted a \nsearch incident to arrest but did not locate anything illegal on Steve's person. While the deputies \nconducted the search, I first used my right knee to apply downward pressure on Steve's legs and then \ntransitioned to both of my hands applying downward pressure to secure Steve's legs for approximately 2 \nminutes to prevent him from kicking. Had I not used downward pressure to secure Steve's legs, he could \nhave hit myself or my partners causing injury. While securing Steve's legs he was able to bump my \ncamera and shut it off just before the WRAP placement. Due to this occurring, my body camera did not \ncapture the WRAP placement and was reactivated when I noticed it was off after the WRAP placement.  \n \nDeputy Maxin secured the ankle restraint. Deputy Maxin, Deputy Paulino (0288), I secured the leg \nrestraint and straps. Deputy Addenbrooke and Deputy Peratis applied the chest restraint with the \nassistance of Deputy Paulino securing the chest restraint to the leg restraint.

(See Deputy Maxin and Deputy Paulino's Deputy Reports for further \ndetail). Sergeant Worthington was present for the WRAP placement and acted as the safety officer. I had \nSteve seated in an upright position while we waited for the Lakeside Fire Department to arrive on scene.  \n \nWhile waiting for paramedics to arrive, Deputy Peratis spoke to the reporting party who was identified as \n who is Steve's \n and the listed protected party in two criminal protective orders where \nSteve is listed as the restrained party. Deputy Peratis obtained a statement from \n in reference to this \nincident and confirmed both the orders were valid and served with a stay away order listed on both (CPO \n#CE400307 and #C416038). \n is listed at the protected party on both CPO's. \n \nLakeside Fire Engine #2 and Lakeside Medic #2 arrived on scene to evaluate Steve. Lakeside Medics \nevaluated him and determined he was unable to orient himself and was unable to recall what year it was \nor how old he was. Lakeside Medics requested Steve be removed from the chest restraint and handcuffs \nin order to properly seat him onto the gurney and into the ambulance. I removed the chest restraint and \nhandcuffs, and Lakeside Medics secured him with soft restraints onto the gurney. Lakeside Medics then \nplaced Steve into the ambulance to be transported to UCSD Hospital. Before leaving to the hospital, \nLakeside Medics asked for my assistance in obtaining his blood sugar in order to properly treat Steve \nand he was refusing. I used downward pressure with both of my hands on Steve's right arm until \nLakeside medics were able to successfully obtain his blood sugar level.  \n \nI rode in the back of the ambulance while Deputy Peratis trailed behind in a patrol car.  While I was in the \nambulance, I took several photographs of Steve. I observed that Steve had four apparent contusions \nfrom the less lethal munitions impact on the following areas of his body: right inner thigh, left wrist, left \nforearm, and left abdomen. I also observed white foam around Steve's mouth, his blank stare, and his \nconstant asking for water. These are symptoms commonly seen with a person under the influence of a \ncontrolled substance.  \n \nLakeside paramedics arrived at UCSD hospital where Steve was transferred to a higher level of care. \nWhile at the hospital, medical staff informed me that Steve likely suffered a fractured left wrist and would \nneed to be placed in a cast. Steve was treated and cleared for jail placement. During the entire incident it \nwas apparent that Steve displayed several signs and symptoms of being under the influence of a \ncontrolled substance due to his erratic behavior, blank stare, non sensical statements, foaming of the \nmouth, involuntary muscular movements, and his inability to follow basic commands, but I was unable to \ncomplete a further evaluation due to him being treated by paramedics. I took several photographs of \nSteve inside the ambulance and at the hospital. UCSD cleared Steve fit for jail placement.  \n \nDeputy Peratis and I transported Steve to the San Diego Central Jail where he was booked for 69 PC- \nRESISTING A PEACE OFFICER and 166 (C)(1) - PC - CONTEMPT OF COURT: VIOLATE \nPROTECTIVE ORDER (M).  \n \nNo deputies sustained injuries due to the use of force.  \n \n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nPublic Records Request \nVictim Copy \n7 \nPage 7 of 7 \n \n \nCase No. 23126779 \nPrimary Victim: \nPeratis, A \nReport No. 23126779.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \n \nSH3927 - TREVINO, GILBERT \nLakeside Substation \nLAKESIDE PATROL \n \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \n \n06/27/2023 00:05:20 \nSH1386 - TRIM, COLBY \n \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH2304 \nPrinted: July 19, 2023 - 11:22 AM \n \n \nAt the Lakeside Substation I placed all photographs onto a CD and placed the CD into evidence.

It was determined to use a CTS 2581 (Super Sock) specialty munitions shotgun in order to \nsafely take Nakho into custody.  \n \nI informed Nakho he needed to comply, or force would be used against him. I gave a final command for Nakho to lay down on \nthe ground and Nakho ignored my commands. I then fired one super sock round with the Less Lethal Shotgun towards \nNakho's lower left abdomen. The round had no effect on Nakho. Nahko continued his erratic behavior as he held on to the \nspatula. I fired a second super sock round towards Nakho's lower left abdomen and fired a third super sock towards Nakho's \nleft upper thigh, as I gave verbal commands to Nakho to get on the ground. The first three deployments had minor effects on \nNakho as he continued his erratic behavior. I then fired a fourth super sock round towards Nakho's inner right thigh causing \nNakho to fall to the ground. At this time, deputies ran toward Nakho to take him into custody. I rendered the less lethal \nshotgun safe, and I had no further contact or involvement in taking Nakho into custody.  \n \nThe force used on scene was used to effect an arrest and necessary during the high-risk incident. Had I not used the level of \nforce I did, it would have only led to further disorder forcing me to use a higher degree of force than needed in the first \ninstance. Using a specialty munitions shotgun was the best option we had considering Nakho's erratic and assaultive \nbehavior. \n \nPhotos were later take of Steve and logged into Evidence at the Lkeside Station. \n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nUse of Force Supplemental \n \n \n    \n(Revised 5/17/13 NetRMS) \n \nPrinted By SH2304 \nPrinted: July 19, 2023 - 11:22 AM \n \nUFO DATE AND TIME \nEVENT NUMBER \nCASE NUMBER \nDOCUMENT NUMBER \nSTATION/FACILITY \n6/26/2023 20:48 \nE8620721 \n23126779 \n141039 \nLAK - Lakeside Substation \nINCIDENT DESCRIPTION / OFFENSES \n A/R 148 PC,166 PC-S-Nakho, Steve \nSUBJECT’S NAME (LAST, FIRST, MI) \nDATE OF BIRTH \nARRESTED \nSUPERVISOR PRESENT \nDATE/TIME SUPERVISOR NOTIFIED \nNakho, Steve William \n \n \n        Yes          No \n     Yes            No \n06/26/2023 20:48 \n \nREASON(S) FOR \nUSING FORCE: \n \nNecessary to effect            \nan arrest \n \nNecessary to defend self or \nanother \n \nNecessary to prevent \nescape/evasion \n \nNecessary to effect a lawful \ndetention \n \nNecessary to prevent a \nviolent forcible felony \n \nNecessary to restrain for \nsubject’s safety \n \nNecessary during high-risk \nincident \n \nNecessary during riot \n \n \nDelaying Jail Operations \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSUBJECT APPEARED TO BE \nNUMBER OF OFFICERS ON SCENE \nNUMBER OF OFFICERS USING FORCE \n      Under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs \n       Mentally impaired \n17 \n1 \n \nLEVEL(S) OF RESISTANCE ENCOUNTERED \n \nNONE (subject cooperated/complied) \n \nPASSIVE RESISTANCE (represents by a refusal to respond  to verbal \ncommands but also offers no form of physical resistance) \n \nPSYCHOLOGICAL INT MIDATION (non-verbal cues indicating subject’s attitude or \nphysical readiness to resist) \n \nACTIVE RESISTANCE (pushing, pulling or running away from the officer to \navoid control; not attempting to harm the officer) \n \nVERBAL NON-COMPLIANCE (subject’s expressed unwillingness to comply with the \nofficer’s commands) \n \nASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR (physical actions of assault) \n \n \nAGGRAVATED ACTIVE AGGRESSION (potential injury or death) \n \nLAW ENFORCEMENT TOOL/TECHNIQUE USED TO GAIN COMPLIANCE OR OVERCOME RESISTANCE (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY) \n \nVerbal Commands: \nComply and lay on the ground \n \n \nEmpty Hand Control \n  Less-Lethal Weapon System \nDischarges \n \nNumber of \n \nTarget \n \n \n    Grab, Push, Pull, or Body Weight \n \n     PepperBall - OC Powder \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Control Hold \n(Duration: ) \n \n     PepperBall - Water \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Pressure Point  (Duration: ) (# of Contacts: ) \n \n     37 mm Rifle - Standard \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Strike  \n(Body part used: ) (# of Contacts: ) \n \n     37 mm Rifle - Low Energy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Takedown  \nType: \n \n \n \n     40 mm Rifle - Bean Bag \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Carotid  (Rendered Unconscious?

After \nsafely applying the ankle strap to Nakho's legs, I assisted Deputy Paulino (#0288) in securing Nakho's legs with the lower leg \nportion of the \"WRAP.\" \n \nOnce secured in the lower portion of the \"WRAP\", I assisted Deputy Peratis (#0720) in securing Nakho in the upper body \nportion of the \"WRAP.\"  I assisted in pulling the upper body portion of the \"WRAP\" over Nakho's head, securing and synching \nthe right-side strap, and leaning Nakho forward, securing the front buckle and strap so Nakho would safely be fully secured in \nthe \"WRAP\" and unable to roll around or flail his body and preventing him from causing injury to him or any Deputies.   \n \nOnce Nakho was safely secured in the \"WRAP,\" I did not have any more involvement with Nakho.   \n \nI believe if the force used had not been used, Nakho could have continued to kick, bite or spit on me or other Deputies present \ncausing injuries to myself or other Deputies. If the \"WRAP\" had not been placed on Nakho's person, he could have continued \nto struggle with Deputies making it difficult for them and medics to treat him properly and safely take him into custody.  I \nbelieve the \"WRAP\" was necessary due to Nakho's aggressive behavior and unwillingness to cooperate with Deputies on \nscene. Nakho could have further injured tried to injure myself or other Deputies on scene if he had not been placed in the \n\"WRAP\" and to avoid a future use of force with Nakho's person while at the residence. The \"WRAP\" minimizes the amount of \nmovement he could have to further hurt myself or other Deputies on scene. \n \nSergeant Worthington (#6928) was on scene throughout the incident.

I pulled Steve's legs toward \nme to flatten his posture. I then went to Steve's right side, used my left knee to put downward pressure on his lower back for \napproximately 30 seconds. I grabbed his left arm and put it behind his back. Deputy Worthington #0363 placed handcuffs on \nhis left wrist as I grabbed his right. I reached under Steve's right arm and pulled it behind his back which I could feel him \nresisting by trying to push his arm forward. I was able to overcome the resistance and handcuff his right wrist behind his back. \nOnce Steve was handcuffed, he was escorted down the stairs, toward the patrol vehicle. Steve started to resist again by not \nwanting to walk forward. I used downward pressure on the back of his head and pulled him forward in order to keep him \nwalking. \n \nIt was decided it would be safer and easier to place Steve in a WRAP device. Steve was taken to the ground and a WRAP \ndevice was applied with Sergeant Worthington as the safety officer. Deputy Maxin assisted with the leg restraints, and I \nassisted with the body harness. I used downward pressure on Steve's back and back of his head to push him forward to apply \nthe WRAP device correctly and firmly. Steve was placed in an upright position until medics came. At this time, I had no further \ncontact with Steve.  \n \nI used this level of force with Steve because he was already told multiple times he was under arrest and had to come down \nthe stairs. Steve responded with \"Fuck you!\", and was still holding the spatula, all while standing on a small platform at the top \nof a stairwell. We do not train any defense tactics on stairwells because it is a very dangerous thing to do. Steve was under \nthe influence a controlled substance and his response and behavior portrayed he was not going to comply with our commands \nwhich he would resist our efforts to arrest him. Had I not used the level of force I did at the top of the stairwell, as quick and as \nhard as I did, it would have only led to further disorder forcing me to use a higher degree of force than needed in the first \ninstance. Using a specialty munitions shotgun was the best option we had. A conducted energy device would have caused \nSteve to lose all control and would have fallen down the stairwell which could have caused a fatal injury. Using oleoresin \ncapsicum (OC) spray would have only contaminated the entire area making a completely unsafe to enter to make an arrest. \nThe decisions we made quickly gained control over Steve to make the arrest quickly.  \n \nPhotos were taken of Steve and later logged into Evidence at the Lakeside Station. \n \nThis concluded my portion of the investigation. \n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nUse of Force Supplemental \n \n \n    \n(Revised 5/17/13 NetRMS) \n \nPrinted By SH2304 \nPrinted: July 19, 2023 - 11:23 AM \n \nUFO DATE AND TIME \nEVENT NUMBER \nCASE NUMBER \nDOCUMENT NUMBER \nSTATION/FACILITY \n6/26/2023 20:48 \nE8620721 \n23126779 \n141029 \nLAK - Lakeside Substation \nINCIDENT DESCRIPTION / OFFENSES \nA/R 69 PC, 166(C)(1) PC-S.

Specific addresses are also not provided in this report. The \npublic interest in such information is limited as it is not necessary to gain an understanding of \nthe incident. Thus, the interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs any public interest in \ndisclosure. \nFor reasons related to privacy, as well as the readability of this report, the witnesses and \nlocations will be indexed as follows: \n• Witness 1 (W1), the individual accused of assaulting an individual with a firearm and \nwho was arrested by the police prior to the search of the residence. \n \n• Witness 2 (W2), Kevin McDonald’s Mother.  \n \n• Location #1, the residence where the shooting occurred.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \nExecutive Summary \n \nOn June 28th, 2023, Richmond Police Department [RPD] personnel were investigating a \nRichmond resident [hereinafter referred to as (W1)] who reportedly committed multiple \nfirearm violations, including an assault with a firearm on June 26th, 2023. As part of the \ninvestigation, RPD officers conducted surveillance at (W1)’s residence [hereinafter referred to \nas location #1].  \nAt approximately 3:00 am, RPD officers observed (W1) exit his residence, enter his car, and \ndrive away. RPD personnel conducted a traffic stop on the vehicle and arrested (W1). RPD \nsearched the vehicle and located a firearm.   \nFollowing W1’s arrest, RPD personnel obtained a search warrant for location #1 to search for \nadditional firearms. RPD officers were aware that an individual named Kevin McDonald \n[hereinafter referred to as MCDONALD] and his mother (W2) also lived at the residence and \nwould likely be inside the home during the search. MCDONALD’s criminal history did not reveal \na history of violence or illegal possession of firearms.   \nAt approximately 9:00 am, multiple Richmond Police officers responded to location #1 to serve \nthe search warrant. The officers knocked on the door of the residence, announced they were \nfrom the Richmond Police Department, and stated that they were there to serve a search \nwarrant. Despite numerous announcements, no one answered the door.   \nOver ten RPD officers entered the home via a garage door located on the side of the residence. \nThe entry team continued into the living room, where they encountered MCDONALD’s mother, \nwho was elderly and appeared disoriented. Multiple members of the team continued to search \nthe residence while one RPD officer remained with MCDONDALD’s mother.  RPD personnel \ncontinued to call out to MCDONALD while repeatedly identifying themselves as the Richmond \nPolice Department.  \nMembers of the RPD team eventually proceeded to the second story of the home where they \nwere tasked with checking and clearing all the rooms for safety purposes. The last room to be \ncleared was located behind a closed door at the end of a hallway.   \nFour RPD officers lined up behind the closed door while a fifth member, Richmond Police \nSergeant Alex Caine, positioned himself on one side of the hallway as a cover officer. Richmond \nPolice Detective Robert Branch was positioned closest to the door, followed by Officer Mauricio \nCanelo, Detective Aaron Pomeroy, and Officer Johnathen McKinney.   \nDetective Robert Branch reached out to open the door and gave another announcement \nidentifying himself as the police. Just prior to opening the door, MCDONALD yelled at the \nofficers, telling them not to come into the room.  \n5 \n \nDetective Branch opened the door and saw MCDONALD seated on his bed facing the door. \nMCDONALD was holding an assault style rifle in his hands and pointed it at the officers. RPD \nOfficers announced “gun.” Detective Branch fired at MCDONALD. In addition, Sergeant Caine, \nwho was positioned at the opposite end of the hallway, fired his weapon at MCDONALD.  \nMCDONALD was struck by the bullets and fell back onto the bed.  \nMCDONALD was administered first aid and additional medical personnel were called to attend \nto him. MCDONALD was later pronounced deceased at the scene by medical personnel.  \nThe Contra Costa Law Enforcement Involved Fatal Incident [LEIFI] Protocol was invoked. All \ninvolved Richmond Police Officers were sequestered and the Law Enforcement Fatal Incident \ninvestigation was initiated.                    \nIn applying the law and California District Attorney’s Uniform Crime Charging Standards to \nthe present case, Richmond Police Detective Robert Branch and Richmond Police \nSergeant Alex Caine acted in lawful self-defense/defense-of-others and their use of force \nwas justified.  As such, no further action will be taken in this case.   \n       \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThis report is the final step in the CCCDAO investigation of the Richmond Police Department’s \nofficer involved shooting incident of Kevin MCDONALD on June 28th, 2023, in Richmond, \nCalifornia. The CCCDAO and every law enforcement agency in Contra Costa County follow the \nLaw Enforcement Involved Fatal Incident Protocol (“the Protocol”)1 to investigate incidents \nwhen officers or civilians are shot, killed, or die during an encounter with law enforcement.2  \n \nUnder the Protocol, the CCCDAO investigates LEIFI incidents that occur in Contra Costa County \nfor the purpose of making an independent determination of criminal liability. The sole purpose \nof the District Attorney investigation is to determine if there is proof beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that an individual involved in the incident committed a crime.  \n \nPursuant to the Protocol, the involved law enforcement agency is required to notify the \nappropriate district attorney personnel immediately after an officer involved shooting. Once \nnotified, trained, and experienced members of the District Attorney’s Office respond to the \nscene and begin the criminal investigation. In addition, criminal investigators from the law \nenforcement agency involved in the incident and from the jurisdiction where the incident \n \n1 Contra Costa County was one of the first counties in the country to adopt a fatal incident protocol between the \nDistrict Attorney and the law enforcement agencies within the county. The complete LEIFI protocol document can \nbe located on the Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office website.  \n2 Although the LEIFI Protocol references “Fatal” incidents, LEIFI protocol is initiated when officers or civilians are \nshot during an encounter with law enforcement, regardless of whether or not the involved individual is killed.  \n6 \n \noccurred, if different, respond to the scene as well. It is important to note that although these \ninvestigations happen simultaneously, each agency conducts its own independent investigation.  \nAs part of the criminal investigation, law enforcement officers and civilians who witnessed the \nincident may be interviewed. Evidence is collected at the scene and may be submitted to the \ncounty crime lab for testing and analysis, in addition to any other relevant investigative work \nnecessary to complete the investigation. The Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Office Crime Lab \nresponds to every incident and is responsible for evidence collection.  \nDuring the course of the criminal investigation, an officer or deputy has the right to be \nrepresented by an attorney. They may voluntarily choose to provide a statement, physical \nevidence, or other relevant information during the criminal and administrative investigations. \nUnder the law, neither an officer nor civilian can be compelled to give a statement as part of a \nlaw enforcement agency administrative investigation only. (See, Public Safety Officers \nProcedural Bill of Rights Act, Government Code Sections 3300 et seq). In accordance with the \nlaw, the CCCDAO does not participate in compelled administrative investigation interviews and \ndoes not review them as part of the independent criminal investigation. There are very narrow \ncircumstances where an exception to this rule is allowed.  \nIndependent of the CCCDAO and in accordance with the Protocol, the Coroner’s Division of the \nContra Costa County Sheriff’s Office (CCCSO) conducts a Coroner’s Inquest following most \ndeaths that involve law enforcement personnel or law enforcement operations or activities \nwithin Contra Costa County. \nThe Coroner’s Inquest is open to the public, conducted by a hearing officer (a private attorney \nhired by the Coroner’s Division) and is held in front of a jury of citizens randomly selected from \nthe Contra Costa County Superior Court jury pool. During the inquest, the hearing officer \nquestions witnesses, and additional evidence may be presented. After hearing all the evidence, \nthe role of the jury is to decide whether the death was by (1) natural causes, (2) suicide, (3) \naccident, or (4) at the hands of another person other than by accident (i.e., homicide). The \njury’s decision has no legal bearing on the civil or criminal investigations or liability of any \nperson(s) involved in the incident. \nINVESTIGATION \nNOTIFICATION AND ASSIGNMENTS: \nOn June 28, 2023, at approximately 9:45 am, the Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office \n[CCCDAO] was notified that the Richmond Police Department [RPD] invoked the LEIFI protocol \nfor an officer involved shooting that occurred at location #1, in the City of Richmond.  \n \nMembers of the District Attorney’s Office LEIFI team as well as personnel from the Richmond \nPolice Department responded to location #1. The scene was secured and marked off with crime \nscene tape by RPD personnel.   \n \n7 \n \nThe CCCSO Forensic Division [Crime Lab] was notified and subsequently arrived at location #1 to \nprocess the scene. The United States Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco, and Explosives \n[ATF] responded due to multiple assault style rifles being located at the residence. The United \nStates Air Force Explosives Ordinance Disposal (EOD) was contacted and arrived at the scene to \nsafely identify, evaluate, and dispose of a live hand grenade located inside the residence.        \n \nAt approximately 12:12 pm, a joint briefing with both RPD and CCCDAO personnel was held.  \nThe briefing was conducted to give an overview of the incident and to review evidence such as \nBody Worn Camera [BWC] footage and dispatch audiotapes. Following the briefing, members of \nthe CCCDAO LEIFI team and RPD personnel were given the following assignments:  \n \n• Senior Inspector Steven Cheatham and RPD Officer Mike Sagan.    \no Interview three RPD personnel, including RPD Officers Robert Branch, RPD \nSergeant Alex Caine, and RPD Lieutenant Elizabeth Bashan (the two actor \nOfficers and the supervising Lieutenant) \n     \n• Senior Inspector Leo Sanchez and RPD Detective Ruben Munguia  \no Interview two of the RPD officers involved in the service of the search warrant, \nincluding RPD officers Richard Ramos and Mauricio Canelo. \no Detective Munguia interviewed the following medical personnel: Paramedic Amy \nStaggs and Richmond Fire Captain John Stevens \n \n• Senior Inspector Kirk Sullivan and RPD Detective Jaime Guzman: \n \no Interview four of the RPD officers involved in the service of the search warrant, \nincluding RPD Officers Alyana Woody, Brian Hoffman, Johnathen McKinney, and \nSergeant Aaron Pomeroy. \n \n• Senior Inspector Fraser Ritchie and RPD Detective Mariah Farr: \n \n \no Interview three of the RPD officers involved in the service of the search warrant, \nincluding RPD officers Alysa Alvarado, Andrew Domenici, and Sergeant James \nMoody. \no Interview MCDONALD’s mother. \n \n• Senior Inspector John Garcia \no Assist the CCCSO Crime Lab, ATF and EOD in the processing and collection of \nevidence from the scene and to witness the Autopsy of MCDONALD. \n \nIn total, twelve (12) police officers and three (3) civilian witnesses were interviewed. ATF \nAgents, the United States Air Force Explosive Ordinance Disposal, and crime scene personnel \nrecovered 47 assault style rifles, hundreds of rounds of live ammunition, and a live grenade. All \nwere seized from inside MCDONALD’S residence.  \n \n8 \n \nEvidence Reviewed:  \n \n• The scene at location #1. \n• Richmond Police Department reports associated with this incident. \n• CCCDAO Investigative reports associated with this incident.  \n• Contra Costa County Crime Lab reports associated with this incident.  \n• Available audio and video camera recordings. \n• Involved officer interviews. \n• Interviews of civilian witnesses. \n• Physical evidence collected from the scene. \n• 911 Call/Radio Traffic.  \n• Autopsy Report. \n• The Search Warrant for location #1.  \n• Coroner’s Inquest Hearing testimony and findings.   \n• Additional Investigative materials. \n \nTIMELINE \nOn the morning of June 28, 2023, RPD Detectives conducted surveillance at location #1 in order \nto locate (W1), who was suspected of committing multipole firearm violations. At \napproximately 3:00 am, (W1) exited his residence at location #1 and left the scene in his car.  \nRPD officers conducted a traffic stop on (W1) and arrested him. A loaded handgun was found in \nhis car.   \nRPD Detectives authored a search warrant to return to location #1 and search the residence for \nadditional firearms. The search warrant was reviewed by a Contra Costa County Superior Court \nJudge. The Richmond Police Department officers conducting the search arrived on scene at \napproximately 9:05 am.  \nThe remainder of this summary will be relayed according to the chronological timeline provided \nby the available Body Worn Camera footage and RPD logs [CAD logs]. All times are \napproximate.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n9:08:22 \nRPD personnel lined up at the side garage door. \n  \n9:08:49 \nRPD personnel discovered the side garage door was unlocked. \n  \n9:08:52 \nRPD personnel started knocking on door and announced their presence.   \n  \nRPD gave announcements and waited for approximately 46 seconds before team entered \n  \nresidence. \n  \n9 \n \n9:09:38 \nRPD entered the residence through the garage door. \n  \n9:09:53 \nRPD moved through the garage and encountered MCDONALD’s mother (W2) in the living  \n  \nroom. They attempted to call her toward them, but she did not respond or move. \n9:11:15 \nRPD personnel proceeded into the living room and contacted (W2). \n9:11:16 \nDetective Branch covered stairway leading to second floor. \n  \n9:11:20 \nRPD announcement, “Richmond Police Department, anybody upstairs come down now.” \n  \nNo one responded. \n  \n9:11:28 \nAn officer asked (W2), “Where is Kevin?” A female voice stated “Upstairs”. \n9:11:29 \nRPD yelled, “Kevin if you’re upstairs, come down now.” \n  \n9:11:45 \nAnother officer yelled, ”Kevin, Richmond Police Department, make yourself known.” \n9:12:30 \nRPD personnel proceeded up the stairs. Detective Branch was in the lead position [per BWC]. \n9:12:37 \nAnother officer announced, “Richmond Police Department.” \n  \n9:12:43 \nDetective Branch proceeded to the second floor and stated that he saw a door  \n  \non the right side of the upper landing. \n  \n9:12:49 \nDetective Branch covered the hallway, as other RPD personnel searched the right side of \n  \nthe second story. \n  \n9:12:51 \nAn RPD officer announced, “Richmond Police Department.” \n  \n09:13:02   Detective Branch and 3 other officers searched three rooms on the left side of left hallway \n9:14:43 \nDetective Branch lined up to lead entry squad into last door at end of the hallway. \n9:14:44 \nDetective Branch looked to right back toward the hallway entrance and saw Sergeant Caine     \n  \nat the end of hallway covering the last door.  \n  \n9:14:50 \nDetective Branch set up to open the last door.  A male voice yelled “Don’t Come in Here.” \n9:14:51 \nDetective Branch yelled, “Richmond Police Department” as he opened the door and  \n  \nthen yelled, “Show Me Your Hands“ two times. \n  \n9:14:53 \nSergeant Caine yelled “Gun, Gun, Gun”, and then Detective Branch yelled “Gun.” \n9:14:54 \nSergeant Caine and Detective Branch fired their rifles at MCDONALD, who had pointed  \n  \na rifle at them as Detective Branch opened the bedroom door. \n  \n9:14:56 \nSergeant Caine yelled the command, “Shot.” \n  \n10 \n \n9:14:57 \nMCDONALD fell back onto the bed. \n  \n9:15:06 \nDetective Branch and RPD personnel entered the room. Detective Branch took the rifle  \n  \nout of McDonald’s hand and placed it on a chair away from McDonald. \n  \n9:15:22 \nMedical Aid was requested. \n  \n9:16:27 \nRPD personnel applied First- Aid. \n  \n9:17:22 \nOfficer McKinney (Trained Paramedic) took over medical care of MCDONALD.  \n9:18:20 \nSergeant Caine and Detective Branch exited the scene to be sequestered. \n \n \n \n17 \n \n \nThis photograph depicts the last two doorways at the end of the left hallway.  The room to the left was \nMCDONALD’s mother’s bedroom.  The room on the right is where MCDONALD was located. \n \n \nThis photograph depicts the interior of MCDONALD’S bedroom. \n18 \n \n \nThis photograph depicts assault rifles on the table on the west wall of MCDONALD’s bedroom. \n \nDuring the walk through of the crime scene by investigative personnel, MCDONALD was located \non the floor lying on his back. His head was facing south next to the bed. He was wearing \nsweatpants with his t-shirt pulled over his neck.  \n \nEvidence Recovery:  \nEvidence recovery, scene documentation and photographs were conducted by the Contra Costa \nCounty Sheriff’s Office, Crime Lab, the Richmond Police Department, and the United States Air \nForce EOD.   \nThe weapon recovered from MCDONALD was a modified, un-serialized, black, AR-15 assault \nrifle. The firearm was equipped with a magazine that contained 29 live, unfired rounds.  One \nlive unfired round was located in the chamber of the gun.  \n19 \n \n \nThe above photograph depicts the weapon recovered from MCDONALD.   \nA full-size mannequin was located inside of MCDONALD’s room. The mannequin was equipped \nwith tactical gear, including a ballistic helmet, tactical vest, and a tactical belt. An assault \nweapon was slung around the mannequin’s neck. \n \nThe above photograph depicts the mannequin located in MCDONALD’s room \nThe Richmond Police Department Crime Scene Investigators collected all the identified assault \nweapons, assorted assault weapons parts, and ammunition found at location #1. In total, forty-\nseven firearms were located and seized in MCDONALD’s bedroom. In addition, hundreds of \n20 \n \nrounds of ammunition and approximately 20 air soft replica firearms were located in his room. \nNumerous firearm components, tools, and machinery used to manufacture firearms were \nlocated in the residence.  \nAn F5 M67 Grenade launcher attachment for an AR-15 rifle was located inside MCDONALD’s \nroom. Additional firearms and rifles were located throughout the residence. A live hand \ngrenade was located in the upstairs room across from the stairs. United States Air Force EOD \npersonnel took possession of the hand grenade, for later destruction.     \n \nThe above photograph depicts the numerous airsoft rifles in MCDONALD’s room. \n \nThe  above photograph depicts the live hand grenade located in the upstairs bedroom.  \nLocated inside MCDONALD’s room was a table that had a mirror and two straws on top of the \ntable. A white powdery substance was located on the mirror. In addition, a pipe commonly \nused to smoke methamphetamine was located on the table.   \nInside the residence the CCC Crime Lab collected ten cartridge casings from the rounds fired by \nDetective Branch and Sergeant Caine. The CCC Crime lab completed a ballistics test on the \ncasings and the firearms used by the officers. The ballistics test determined that four of the \n21 \n \ncartridge cases were fired by Sergeant Caine’s rifle and six were fired from Detective Branch’s \nrifle.   \nThe CCC Crime Lab collected multiple deformed bullets/fragments during the investigation that \nwere believed to have been fired from Detective Branch and Sergeant Caine during the fatal \nincident.      \nBODY WORN CAMERAGE FOOTAGE: \n \nAt the time of the search warrant, multiple Richmond Police personnel were equipped with a \nBody Worn Camera [BWC]. Sergeant Caine did not have his BWC on his person at the time of \nthe shooting.   \n \nA review of the available BWC minutes before the shooting shows Detective Branch and the \nother RPD personnel searching the rooms down the left upstairs hallway and then advancing \nsouth toward MCDONALD’s bedroom. Detective Branch and the other RPD personnel set up to \nclear the last room to the left of their location. The last room was located at the end of the \nhallway. The camera footage shows a view of the hallway toward the stairs, (Northward \ndirection), away from the last door at the end of the hall. Prior to entry into MCDONALD’s \nroom, Detective Branch’s BWC shows the upper half of Sergeant Caine’s torso, and he was \nlooking in Detective Branch’s direction.   \n \nSergeant Caine was positioned to cover RPD personnel as they went down the left hallway.  \nSergeant Caine stayed in that position to cover Detective Branch as Detective Branch prepared \nto open the last door at the end of the hallway.  \nDetective Branch’s BWC depicts him reaching out to open MCDONALD’s bedroom door as a \nmale voice [MCDONALD] yelled, “Do not come in here”.  Detective Branch opened the door and \nyelled, “Richmond Police Department, show me your hands”, two times. The camera view was \nblocked by the left wall of the doorway, which Detective Branch used for cover. As he opened \nthe door, the camera footage into the room was also blocked by Detective Branch’s hands and \nrifle.    \nDetective Branch points his rifle into the room, in the direction of MCDONALD. Available BWC \ncaptured both Sergeant Caine and Detective Branch yell, “gun.” Detective Branch’s BWC shows \nDetective Branch fire his rifle into the room approximately six to eight times. BWC footage \nbriefly showed MCDONALD fall back onto the bed, which he was seated on, in the south part of \nthe room. Detective Branch entered the bedroom and stopped near the bed. Detective Branch \ncan be seen taking an AR-15 style rifle out of MCDONALD’s hand.          \n \n \n24 \n \ninvestigation into (W1), who resided at that location.  (W1) was a suspect in two separate \ninstances where he was allegedly armed with a firearm.     \nPrior to the search of the residence, RPD personnel confirmed the location of (W1)’s residence \nand what car he was driving.  RPD personnel arrested (W1) after he drove away from his \nresidence.  RPD personnel recovered a firearm inside (W1)’s vehicle.   \nFollowing his arrest, (W1) provided information to RPD personnel that a handgun, a shotgun, \nand a rifle were located in his room at the residence. In addition, (W1) provided information \nthat a person named Kevin MCDONALD and his elderly mother lived in the residence.  \nRPD personnel authored a search warrant for (W1)’s residence and presented the search \nwarrant to a judge, who approved the search. Sergeant Caine planned the operation and \nsubmitted the plan to Lieutenant Bashan. Lieutenant Bashan approved the operation. Sergeant \nCaine conducted a briefing of TRT personnel and designated their respective assignments.   \nSergeant Caine and the TRT team responded to location #1.  Sergeant Caine was wearing a fully \nmarked Richmond Police uniform and was equipped with his department issued Colt AR-15 \nrifle. Sergeant Caine was wearing his BWC on his vest earlier in the day, but while preparing for \nthe search, he inadvertently forgot to transfer his BWC when he changed into a tactical vest.   \nOnce on scene Sergeant Caine and the TRT team attempted to enter the front door of the \nresidence. However, upon approach, they discovered the area near the front door was under \nconstruction, so the team proceeded to the side garage door. Once at the side garage door the \nTRT team provided multiple knock notice announcements.4 The team waited at the door for \napproximately a minute to a minute and a half, at which point they continued to give knock \nnotice announcements. After receiving no response, Sergeant Caine instructed another officer \nto knock on the wall to give additional knock notice announcements.   \nDespite numerous knock notice announcements, no one answered the door. As a result, the \nTRT opened the door using a key they obtained from (W1) following his arrest. The team \nentered through the side garage door. Once inside Sergeant Caine saw numerous used paper \nsilhouette shooting targets on the walls. Sergeant Caine’s observation of the used targets made \nhim feel uneasy.  \nThe TRT team continued to announce their presence as they went through the garage. Once \nthey entered the living room he saw an elderly female. She seemed disoriented and the team \ncontinued to search the lower level of the residence. Team members continued to announce, \n \n4 “Knock notice” is a legal term referring to the requirement that an officer knock on the door of a residence and \nannounce their presence as a police officer when serving a search warrant.  After announcing their presence, the \nlaw requires law enforcement to wait a reasonable period of time to allow the occupant/s to respond, prior to law \nenforcement forcible entering a home.     \n25 \n \n“Richmond Police Department” and yelled Kevin’s name to get him to respond. Sergeant Caine \nwas cognizant of the fact no one was responding when calling for MCDONALD, which he felt \nwas unusual.  \nIn total, twelve RPD personnel entered the residence. Once inside, multiple TRT members \nbegan securing the home.  During a typical search, Sergeant Caine sends four TRT members into \neach room to secure the area. A different four-person squad would then search the next room. \nThe squads would go from room to room, until the entire search was complete. The TRT team \nproceeded in this manner during the search.    \nThe purpose of this search method is to identify and locate any people or suspects in the \nresidence or building. For officer safety reasons, people who are discovered are detained and \nmoved to a secure area. A detailed search for evidence would then be conducted after all \nsubjects who could interfere with the search were detained. \nAfter clearing the first floor Sergeant Caine sent all but one person upstairs to continue to \nsearch for MCDONALD, who they believed may still be in the residence. The one team member \nwho remained downstairs stayed with the elderly female they found on the first floor.  \nOnce upstairs he saw there was a hallway to his left and a room to the right across from the \nstairs. Three doors were located on the left side of the left hallway. The door at the end of the \nhallway was closed. Sergeant Caine directed a squad of four TRT team members to the left and \nanother four to the right.  \nThe squad who proceeded down the hallway entered the first room. He then asked the squad \nmembers he had directed to search the room to the right if they had completed their search \nbecause he wanted the teams to continue searching the additional rooms down the hallway. At \nthis point, however, the right-side squad had not finished their search and could not link up \nwith the squad in the left hallway. Both squads continued to loudly announce their presence \nand asked for MCDONALD by name, but he did not respond.  \nSergeant Caine saw the search team complete their search of the second to last room in the left \nhallway and then saw the team line up behind the door of the last room. Detective Branch was \npositioned as the first person in front of the door, with a line of officers stacked up behind him.    \nSergeant Caine leaned out into the hallway and pointed his rifle at the door as Detective Branch \nprepared to open the door to the last room. Sergeant Caine covered the door for any possible \nlethal threat. Sergeant Caine yelled, “Hey Kevin, Richmond Police Department, if you’re inside, \nmake yourself known.” There was no answer or noise from the room.   \nDetective Branch position himself by the left side of the door frame as he prepared to open the \ndoor. Detective Branch reached out and checked the doorknob, to determine if the door was \n26 \n \nlocked. Sergeant Caine leaned farther to his right into the hallway to make sure Detective \nBranch was not in the line of sight of his rifle.  \nJust prior to Detective Branch opening the door, Sergeant Caine heard a male voice say, “You \nbetter not come in here.” Sergeant Caine was surprised and realized MCDONALD was in the \nroom. Detective Branch opened the door. Sergeant Caine saw a white male adult, sitting on the \nbed directly in his line of sight. The white male raised an AR variant type rifle and pointed it at \nhim. Detective Branch moved into the threshold of the room, but Detective Branch was not in \nSergeant Caine’s line of fire. \nSergeant Caine had a clear view of the white male pointing a rifle at him. Sergeant Caine yelled \n“gun.” In his mind Sergeant Caine quickly eliminated any non-lethal options which may have \nbeen available to him in this situation. His first thoughts were, could he deploy a flash bang5, a \ndiversionary device or a taser, but he quickly decided none of those options would be effective \nin that moment. Sergeant Caine saw Detective Branch move into the threshold of the room.  \nSergeant Caine leaned more to his right, to keep Detective Branch out of his line of fire and \nyelled “gun” again.   \nSergeant Caine fired his rifle at MCDONALD. Sergeant Caine believed MCDONALD was going to \nshoot and kill him and his teammates as they entered the room. He saw Detective Branch move \nfurther into the threshold of the door and he saw Detective Branch fire his rifle at MCDONALD. \nDetective Branch then moved into his line of fire and Sergeant Caine stopped pointing his rifle \ndown the hallway. Sergeant Caine saw MCDONALD fall backwards after he and Detective \nBranch fired their rifles.   \nSergeant Caine yelled, “shot,” which is a command given in order for everyone to freeze and to \nprevent friendly fire. Sergeant Caine quickly told the team to go into the room. Sergeant Caine \nfelt the concussion from the fired rounds and was not sure if MCDONALD had fired his rifle at \nthem. He quickly assessed if he was not injured.   \nSergeant Caine went forward down the hallway into the room where MCDONALD was located.  \nThe TRT team cleared the room for other threats. Sergeant Caine recalled seeing a belt fed \nmachine gun on a tripod inside the room as well as numerous AR type rifles.   \nSergeant Caine saw MCDONALD was bleeding profusely from his head and obtained a first aid \nkit from Officer Woody. Sergeant Caine called up Officer McKinney, who was a former Navy \nCorpsman. Sergeant Caine believed Officer McKinney was the best trained person to care for \nMCDONALD.   \n \n5 A flash bang is a non-lethal explosive device that emits an extremely loud noise and bright lights to disorient an \nindividual or group of individuals.   \n27 \n \nSergeant Caine radioed for medical assistance. He then checked to see if other team members \nwere injured and learned no one else was harmed.  He directed the squad to perform a \nsecondary search to determine if anyone else was in the residence. Sergeant Caine directed \nSergeants Pomeroy and Moody to take over command of the operation, as he and Detective \nBranch were to be sequestered.  \nSergeant Caine went outside and saw that there appeared to be bullet exit holes in the exterior \nof the residence, from the upstairs room. Sergeant Caine had officers complete an area canvass \nand welfare check in the neighborhood in order to determine if anyone was harmed by the \nbullets which exited the residence. Sergeant Caine was advised that no one else was harmed.  \nSergeant Caine and other members of the TRT were then sequestered. \nInterview of Richmond Police Detective Robert Branch \nOn June 28, 2023, at approximately 6:26 pm, RPD Officer Mike Sagan and CCCDAO Senior \nInspector Steven Cheatham interviewed Richmond Police Detective Robert Branch. Detective \nBranch was represented by attorney Joe Lucia, from the Law Firm of Rains, Lucia, and Stern.  \nThe following is a summary of his interview:    \nDetective Branch has been a Richmond Police Officer for approximately 17 years. Detective \nBranch started in patrol, but in 2015 he was selected as a Detective in the Domestic and Sexual \nAssault Unit. In 2020 he was reassigned back to Patrol. In 2022 he was assigned as a Detective \nin the Robbery Division and is currently a member of the Tactical Response Team (TRT). \nBoth the SWAT team and the TRT unit serve criminal search warrants.  A threat analysis is \nconducted for all search warrants to determine whether the SWAT team or TRT unit will \nconduct the search. The TRT unit conducts searches that are considered low risk.  The TRT unit \nand the SWAT team are trained quarterly. Detective Branch has completed six trainings, which \nincluded entry training and scenario-based training involving both the SWAT team and the Crisis \nNegotiation Team (CNT).  \nOn the date of this incident, Detective Branch was wearing a clearly marked police uniform with \nbadges and police insignias on his uniform. Detective Branch carried his department issued Colt \nAR-15 rifle for this operation. The objective of the search was to determine if firearms were \nlocated inside the residence.    \nAt approximately 8:00 am he attended an operation briefing at the Richmond Police \nDepartment. The supervisors for this entry were Sergeants Pomeroy, Caine, and Moody.  \nLieutenant Bashan was the overall incident commander.  \nDetective Branch approached the residence in a line with Detective Canelo, Detective Ramos, \nDetective Domenici, as well as an additional RPD officer, whose name he could not recall. The \n28 \n \nentry team changed their initial entry point from the front door to the side garage door \nbecause the front door area was under construction and inaccessible.  \nThe entry team knocked on the door multiple times and announced their presence as officers \nmultiple times. After receiving no reply, the entry team used keys to the side garage door that \nthey had in their possession and entered the garage. Announcements were continually given \nwhile they were inside the garage.  \nDetective Branch saw an elderly female inside the residence from his position inside the garage.  \nThe entry team tried to direct her to come to them, but she did not respond. Officers \napproached her and detained her. Detective Branch covered the stairs to the second floor, as \nother members searched the lower level for anyone else. Detective Branch was briefed that \nthere may be an elderly female and a subject by the name of ‘Kevin” inside the residence.  \nMembers of the TRT yelled MCDONALD’s name several times but received no response.  \nDetective Branch and other TRT members went upstairs to the second floor. Once on the \nsecond floor he saw a hallway to the left of the stairway and a door on the right wall, across \nfrom the stairway. Several additional doors were located down the hallway.  \nDetective Branch searched two rooms down the hallway with other members of TRT in order to \ndetermine if any individuals were inside the residence. After searching the last room on the left, \nthere was one additional door at the end of the hallway that needed to be cleared.  Detective \nBranch positioned himself closest to the door while additional TRT members were stacked \nbehind him.   \nDetective Branch was preparing to open the door to the room when he heard a male voice \nfrom inside say, “don’t come in here.” Detective Branch reached for the doorknob to see if the \ndoor was locked and discovered it was not. He turned the doorknob and opened the door. He \nimmediately saw a white male [later identified as MCDONALD] sitting upright in the bed at the \nfar end of the room. MCDONALD was facing Detective Branch and had a rifle in his hands. \nMCDONALD was pointing the rifle at Detective Branch’s face, prompting Detective Branch to \npoint his rifle at MCDONALD and fired seven to ten times.  \nDetective Branch stated that he feared for his life and the life of his teammates and believed \nthat MCDONALD intended to shoot him. Detective Branch believed there was no available time \nto de-escalate this situation and had nowhere to retreat to. Detective Branch believed the only \nreason MCDONALD did not shoot him was because he fired at MCDONALD first.   \nDetective Branch saw MCDONALD fall back down on the bed while still holding the rifle. He \nentered the room and took the rifle out of MCDONALD’s hands. Detective Branch saw \nMCDONALD had bullet wounds to his head and saw blood on one of his legs.  \n29 \n \nDetective Branch was subsequently sequestered and escorted out of the residence. \nInterview of Richmond Police Lieutenant Elizabeth Bashan: \nOn June 28th, 2023, at approximately 5:45 pm, CCCDAO Senior Inspector Steven Cheatham and \nRichmond Officer Mike Sagan interviewed Richmond Police Lieutenant Elizabeth Bashan.  \nPresent for the interview was Richmond Police Officer Association [POA] President, Sergeant \nBenjamin. Listed below is a summary of the interview:  \nLieutenant Bashan has been a Richmond Police Officer since 2011 and was promoted to \nSergeant, where she was as a member of the Tactical Response Team (TRT). She had been \ninvolved in five to ten search warrant service operations as a member of the TRT.  The TRT \ntrains with the SWAT team and performs entry training on a regular basis. Lieutenant Bashan \nwas promoted to Lieutenant in January 2022. In April of 2023 she was assigned as the \nInvestigations Commander and was the Commander of the TRT.   \nLieutenant Bashan became aware of an investigation of (W1) on June 26, 2023. She was briefed \nby her detectives that (W1) was under investigation for two separate incidents, including \nbrandishing a firearm and a violation of Penal Code Section 246 [shooting at a \nvehicle/residence/etc.] Surveillance on (W1) indicated that (W1) resided at location #1, in the \nCity of Richmond. \nIn the early morning hours of June 28, 2023, RPD officers observed (W1) leave his residence in a \nvehicle. Officers conducted a car stop and arrested (W1). A handgun was recovered from the \nvehicle during the car stop.  \nAfter his arrest, Officer Alvarado and Sergeant Caine authored a search warrant for location #1 \nin order to locate additional firearms. Once the search warrant was authorized, Lieutenant \nBashan completed a threat assessment and determined the Tactical Response Team (TRT) was \nthe appropriate team to conduct the entry and search of the residence.    \nBased on information available at the time, an individual identified as Kevin McDonald was \nbelieved to be inside the residence. A search of his criminal history indicated that he had no \nrecent violent or weapons related crimes. In addition, it was believed that an elderly female \nmay be inside the residence.   \nTRT personnel was briefed and Lieutenant Bashan was designated as the incident commander \nfor the operation. The Sergeants assigned to the TRT Unit would be the supervisors during the \nentry and search of the residence. Lieutenant Bashan was positioned within line of sight of the \nresidence and would call in additional resources, if needed.   \nLieutenant Bashan saw the team approach the residence and heard the knock and notice \nannouncements. Lieutenant Bashan could not estimate the amount of time the team waited at \n30 \n \nthe door before entering the residence. The team then made entry and she lost sight of the \nteam as they went inside.   \nOver the police radio she heard the TRT team contact someone inside the residence. The search \nof location #1 took a significant amount of time due to the size of the residence. At one point \nshe heard someone over the radio ask if a bedroom was clear.   \nAt one point Lieutenant Bashan heard multiple gunshots from inside the residence and then \nheard Sergeant Caine advise, over the radio, that shots were fired. She told Detective Guzman, \nwho was nearby, to relay that information over the RPD main channel. Lieutenant Bashan \nheard Sergeant Caine advised the suspect was in critical condition.   \nDetective Guzman requested an ambulance to respond to the residence. The residence was \nsecured, and Lieutenant Bashan went inside the home. She identified the officers who had shot \nat the suspect, as well as the witness officers, so she could initiate the LEIFI Protocol.   \nInterview of Richmond Police Detective Mauricio Canelo \nOn June 28, 2023, at approximately 8:12 PM, Senior Inspector Leo Sanchez and RPD Detective \nMunguia interviewed Detective Mauricio Canelo. Detective Canelo was represented by an \nattorney, Harry S. Stern, from the Law Firm of Rains, Lucia, and  Stern.

Detective Canelo has been a member of the \nRichmond Police Department SWAT team for the last 6 years and is also a member of the TRT \nteam.  \n \nOn today’s date he was assigned to assist in a search of location #1 as a member of the TRT. \nDetective Canelo attended a briefing of the search and received information that was  \nconsistent with the description provided by the other involved police officers in this LEIFI \ninvestigation.     \n  \nDuring the search of the residence Detective Canelo was wearing a standard RPD black tactical \nutility uniform and vest with fully marked Richmond Police patches and insignia. Detective \nCanelo was equipped with an AR-15 rifle and a Nighthawk handgun. Officer Canelo was wearing \nhis BWC, which was activated for the search of the residence. Detective Canelo believed he may \nhave accidentally turned off his BWC but turned it back on once he noticed it may have turned \noff.  \n \nDetective Canelo was assigned to the #1 position of the stacking order during the initial entry \ninto the home. The following officers were behind him: Detective Ramos, Sergeant Pomeroy, \n31 \n \n(who would conduct knock notice announcements), Officer Domenici, Detective Branch, Officer \nHoffman, and Officer McKinney. Detective Canelo described entering into the residence and \nsearching the first floor of the home in a manner that was generally consistent with the \nstatements of the other officers and available BWC.  \n \nDetective Canelo and the TRT then proceeded to the second floor of the residence.  Detective \nCanelo was the last team member in a line as the team went up the stairs. Detective Canelo \nproceeded down the long narrow hallway on the left and began to search the second floor \nrooms to see if anyone was inside the home.   \n \nAt one point Detective Canelo assisted in the search of the last room at the end of the left \nhallway.  Prior to entering the room, he saw Sergeant Caine positioned at the end of the left \nhallway, taking a rear cover position. Detective Canelo positioned himself behind Detective \nBranch, who was closest to door. Detective Canelo did not hear anything or anyone in the last \nroom prior to Detective Branch opening the door.   \n  \nDetective Canelo saw Detective Branch open the door by pushing it in and begin to move into \nthe threshold of the doorway. Detective Canelo heard Detective Branch yell “gun,” and then \nheard and saw Detective Branch fire his rifle into the room. Detective Canelo was behind \nDetective Branch but was not able to see into the room.   \n \nDetective Canelo heard separate gunshots coming from down the hallway and someone yell, \n“shot.” In total, Detective Canelo heard approximately 3-4 gunshots from Detective Branch and \nat least one gunshot from what was later learned to be from Sergeant Caine. Detective Canelo \ndid not fire his weapon.  \n  \nAfter a brief pause he entered the room with Detective Branch. Detective Canelo saw \nMCDONALD lying on a bed motionless, faceup with a short barrel rifle to his side. Detective \nCanelo saw MCDONALD was bleeding and had been shot in the face and head. Detective Canelo \nheard team members advising on the radio, that an OIS had occurred. Detective Canelo heard a \nrequest for medical personnel and saw Officer McKinney administering first aid care to \nMCDONALD by providing direct pressure with medical gauze.   \n \n \n32 \n \nInterviews of the following RPD Personnel:  Detective Richard Ramos; Officer Alyana Woody; \nDetective Brian Hoffman; Officer Johnathen McKinney; Sergeant Aaron Pomeroy; Sergeant \nJames Moody; Officer Andrew Domenici; and Officer Alysa Alvarado: \n \nDuring the course of the LEIFI Investigation all members of the TRT team serving the search \nwarrant at location #1 were interviewed by multiple CCCDAO Senior Investigators and RPD \nDetectives. On whole, their interviews were generally consistent amongst each other and the \navailable BWC footage.   \nOf note, although all the involved officers who were inside the residence heard multiple \nannouncements and heard shots being fired, due to their positioning in the residence and the \nnarrow confines of the home, none of the above listed individuals were able to see the fatal \nincident.     \nINTERVIEWS OF MEDCIAL PERSONNEL: \nInterview of Paramedic Amy Skaggs \nOn July 3, 2023, at approximately 8:00 am RPD Detective Munguia interviewed American \nMedical Response Paramedic Amy Skaggs.

After \npresentation of the evidence, the jury concluded that the death of MCDONALD was by, \n“Suicide.”     \n \n \n \n \n6 Delta 9 THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis.  \n36 \n \nLEGAL PRINCIPLES \n \nThe California District Attorneys Association Uniform Crime Charging Standards Manual \ndirects that criminal charges shall not be brought unless the prosecutor, based upon a \ncomplete investigation and thorough consideration of all the pertinent information readily \navailable to him or her, believes there is evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt, \nthat the accused is guilty of the crime to be charged. Additionally, the charging standards \ndirect that there must be legally sufficient admissible evidence to prove each element of the \ncrime.  The admissible evidence must be of such convincing force that it would warrant \nconviction of the crime charged by a reasonable and objective fact finder after the fact finder \nhas heard all the evidence and after considering the most plausible, reasonable, and \nforeseeable defenses that could be raised under the evidence. \n \nThe applicable California Penal Code Sections and Jury Instructions [CALCRIM] are as follows: \n \nPursuant to CALCRIM 220: [Reasonable Doubt Jury Instruction] \n \nThe fact that a criminal charge has been filed against the defendant is not evidence that the \ncharge is true.  You must not be biased against the defendant just because he has been \narrested, charged with a crime, or brought to trial.   \n \nA defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent.  This presumption requires that the \nPeople prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  [ ]  \n \nProof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you with an abiding conviction that the \ncharge is true. The evidence need not eliminate all possible doubt because everything in life is \nopen to some possible or imaginary doubt.   \n \nIn deciding whether the People have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt, you must \nimpartially compare and consider all the evidence that was received throughout the entire trial.  \nUnless the evidence proves the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, he is entitled to \nan acquittal, and you must find him not guilty.   \n \nSection 187: Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being or fetus with malice aforethought. \n \nSection 188: Such malice may be express or implied. It is express when there is manifested a \ndeliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a human being. It is implied when the \nkilling resulted from an intentional act, the natural consequences of the act are dangerous to \nhuman life, and the act was deliberately done with knowledge of the danger to and with \nconscious disregard for human life. \n \nSection 192: Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice. \n \n37 \n \nSection 196: Homicide is justifiable when committed by peace officers and those acting by their \ncommand in their aid and assistance, under either of the following circumstances: \n(a) In obedience to any judgment of a competent court. \n(b) When the homicide results from a peace officer’s use of force that is in compliance \nwith Section 835a. \n \nSection 835a: (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following: \n \n(1) That the authority to use physical force, conferred on peace officers by this section, is a \nserious responsibility that shall be exercised judiciously and with respect for human rights and \ndignity and for the sanctity of every human life. The Legislature further finds and declares that \nevery person has a right to be free from excessive use of force by officers acting under color of \nlaw. \n \n(2) As set forth below, it is the intent of the Legislature that peace officers use deadly force only \nwhen necessary in defense of human life. In determining whether deadly force is necessary, \nofficers shall evaluate each situation in light of the particular circumstances of each case, and \nshall use other available resources and techniques if reasonably safe and feasible to an \nobjectively reasonable officer. \n \n(3) That the decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated carefully and thoroughly, \nin a manner that reflects the gravity of that authority and the serious consequences of the use \nof force by peace officers, in order to ensure that officers use force consistent with law and \nagency policies. \n \n(4) That the decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated from the perspective of a \nreasonable officer in the same situation, based on the totality of the circumstances known to or \nperceived by the officer at the time, rather than with the benefit of hindsight, and that the \ntotality of the circumstances shall account for occasions when officers may be forced to make \nquick judgments about using force. \n \n(5) That individuals with physical, mental health, developmental, or intellectual disabilities are \nsignificantly more likely to experience greater levels of physical force during police interactions, \nas their disability may affect their ability to understand or comply with commands from peace \nofficers. It is estimated that individuals with disabilities are involved in between one-third and \none-half of all fatal encounters with law enforcement. \n \n(b) Any peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has \ncommitted a public offense may use objectively reasonable force to effect the arrest, to \nprevent escape, or to overcome resistance. \n \n38 \n \n(c) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), a peace officer is justified in using deadly force upon \nanother person only when the officer reasonably believes, based on the totality of the \ncircumstances, that such force is necessary for either of the following reasons: \n \n(A) To defend against an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or \nto another person. \n \n(B) To apprehend a fleeing person for any felony that threatened or resulted in death or \nserious bodily injury, if the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death \nor serious bodily injury to another unless immediately apprehended. Where feasible, a \npeace officer shall, prior to the use of force, make reasonable efforts to identify \nthemselves as a peace officer and to warn that deadly force may be used, unless the \nofficer has objectively reasonable grounds to believe the person is aware of those facts. \n \n(2) A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger that person \nposes to themselves, if an objectively reasonable officer would believe the person does not \npose an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or to another \nperson. \n \nSection 197: Homicide is also justifiable when committed by any person in any of the \nfollowing cases: \n \n1. When resisting any attempt to murder any person, or to commit a felony, or to \ndo some great bodily injury upon any person; or, \n \n2. When committed in defense of habitation, property, person, against one who \nmanifestly intends or endeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a felony, or \nagainst one who manifestly intends or endeavors, in a violent, riotous or \ntumultuous manner, to enter the habitation of another for the purpose of \noffering violence to any person therein; or, \n \n3. When committed in the lawful defense of such person, or of a wife or husband, \nparent, child, master, mistress, or servant of such person, when there is \nreasonable ground to apprehend a design to commit a felony or to do some \ngreat bodily injury, and imminent danger of such design being accomplished; but \nsuch person, or the person in whose behalf the defense was made, if he was the \nassailant or engaged in mutual combat, must really and in good faith have \nendeavored to decline any further struggle before the homicide was committed; \nor \n \n4. When necessarily committed in attempting, by lawful ways and means, to \napprehend any person for any felony committed, or in lawfully suppressing any \n39 \n \nriot, or in lawfully keeping and preserving the peace. \n \nSection 199: The homicide appearing to be justifiable or excusable, the person indicted must, \nupon his trial, be fully acquitted and discharged. \n \nPursuant to CALCRIM 507: \n \nA homicide by a peace officer is justifiable and not unlawful when: \n1. The defendant was a peace officer \n \nAND \n \n2. The killing was committed while the defendant \n \neither: \n \nA. Reasonably believed, based on the totality of the \ncircumstances, that the force was necessary to defend against \nan imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the \ndefendant or another person; \n \nOR \n \nB. Reasonably believed, based on the totality of the circumstances, that:  \n \n(1) A person was fleeing a felony; \n \n(2) That force was necessary to arrest or detain that person; \n \n(3) The commissioned felony threatened or resulted in death or serious bodily injury,  \n \nAND \n \n(4) The person will cause death or serious bodily injury to another unless immediately \napprehended.  \n \nPursuant to CALCRIM 505. Justifiable Homicide: Self-Defense \n \nThe defendant is not guilty of murder or manslaughter if he was justified in killing someone in \nself-defense.  The defendant acted in lawful (self-defense/ [or] defense of another) if: \n40 \n \n1. The defendant reasonably believed that he was in imminent danger of being killed or \nsuffering great bodily injury; \n2. The defendant reasonably believed that the immediate use of deadly force was necessary to \ndefend against that danger; \nAND \n3. The defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against that \ndanger. \nBelief in future harm is not sufficient, no matter how great or how likely the harm is believed to \nbe. The defendant must have believed there was imminent danger of death or great bodily \ninjury to himself. Defendant’s belief must have been reasonable and he must have acted only \nbecause of that belief. The defendant is only entitled to use that amount of force that a \nreasonable person would believe is necessary in the same situation. If the defendant used more \nforce than was reasonable, the killing was not justified. \nWhen deciding whether the defendant’s beliefs were reasonable, consider all the \ncircumstances as they were known to and appeared to the defendant and consider what a \nreasonable person in a similar situation with similar knowledge would have believed. If the \ndefendant’s beliefs were reasonable, the danger does not need to have actually existed. \nThe defendant’s belief that he was threatened may be reasonable even if he relied on \ninformation that was not true. However, the defendant must actually and reasonably have \nbelieved that the information was true. \nA defendant is not required to retreat. He or she is entitled to stand his or her ground and \ndefend himself and, if reasonably necessary, to pursue an assailant until the danger of death or \ngreat bodily injury has passed. This is so even if safety could have been achieved by retreating. \nGreat bodily injury means significant or substantial physical injury. It is an injury that is greater \nthan minor or moderate harm. \nThe People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not \njustified. If the People have not met this burden, you must find the defendant not guilty of \nmurder or manslaughter.  \n \n \n41 \n \nLEGAL ANALYSIS \n \nThe legal issue to be decided by the CCCDAO is whether any involved law enforcement \nofficers or civilians violated any criminal laws. The Contra Costa District Attorney’s Office \nanalyzes each fatal incident on the case specific facts and circumstances. The community, \nincluding the deceased, his family, and the involved officers deserve an independent factual \nand legal analysis. Whether someone is criminally liable depends on the facts of the case \nand whether those facts constitute a crime under the applicable laws.   \n \nThe California District Attorneys Association Uniform Crime Charging Standards Manual \ndirects that criminal charges shall not be brought unless the prosecutor, based upon a \ncomplete investigation and thorough consideration of all the pertinent information readily \navailable to him or her, believes there is evidence that proves beyond a reasonable doubt, \nthat the accused is guilty of the crime to be charged. Additionally, the charging standards \ndirect that there must be legally sufficient admissible evidence to prove each element of the \ncrime. The admissible evidence must be of such convincing force that it would warrant \nconviction of the crime charged by a reasonable and objective fact finder after the fact finder \nhas heard all the evidence and after considering the most plausible, reasonable, and \nforeseeable defenses that could be raised under the evidence. \n \nIn the present case, a review of all of the available evidence reveals that Richmond Police \nDetective Robert Branch and Richmond Police Sergeant Alex Caine acted in lawful self-\ndefense/defense of others.  Both officers reasonably believed they were in imminent danger of \nserious bodily injury or death; both officers reasonably believed the immediate use of force was \nnecessary to defend against that danger; and both officers used no more force that was \nreasonably necessary under the circumstances. As such, their use of deadly force was justified.   \n \nOn June 28th, 2023, both Sergeant Caine and Detective Branch were conducting a search of a \nresidence where probable cause existed to believe a firearm would be located inside and that \none or more individuals would be located inside the home. An officer under these \ncircumstances would reasonably believe that a potentially dangerous and/or violent incident \nmay occur during the execution of the search. \n \nIn addition, prior to the shooting, multiple used firearm targets were found on display inside \nthe home along with various tools used to manufacture/mill/alter firearms. A reasonable officer \nunder these circumstances would believe that the individual in possession of the firearm is \nactively firing their weapon and is more likely to have additional firearms in the residence.     \n \nFurthermore, multiple RPD officers announced their presence and actively called out to \nMCDONALD in order to avoid a potentially dangerous encounter. Unfortunately, despite the \nofficer’s attempts to safely secure the home, MCDONALD did not respond to the officers until \nthe moment they entered his room. An officer under these circumstances would reasonably \n42 \n \nconclude, upon suddenly discovering MCDONALD, that he was hiding his presence because he \nintended to use force or violence when located by police.   \n \nFinally, once Detective Branch opened the door to MCDONALD’s bedroom, MCDONALD did not \nsubmit to lawful detention. Instead, MCDONALD was positioned upright on his bed facing the \ndoorway, armed with a loaded assault rifle, and pointed the weapon at the officers who were \njust feet away. An officer, under these circumstances, would reasonably conclude that deadly \nforce was necessary to defend against the imminent threat of death that MCDONALD’s actions \npresented.      \n \nDue to the speed and relatively close proximity of this incident, neither Detective Branch nor \nSergeant Caine could effectively attempt to use non-lethal force or verbally de-escalate the \nencounter. Simply put, MCDONALD thrust the officers into a position where they would have to \neither shoot MCDONALD or be shot. Accordingly, the use of deadly force used by Sergeant \nCaine and Detective Branch was justified.   \n \nCONCLUSION:  \n \nIn applying the law and the California District Attorney’s Uniform Crime Charging Standards \nto the present case, Richmond Police Detective Robert Branch and Richmond Police Sergeant \nAlex Caine acted in lawful self-defense/defense of others and their use of deadly force was \njustified. As such, no further action will be taken in this case.",

This is not \nthe first incident Ofc. Arone has had a Use of Force incident come into question. Ofc. \nArone is a Defensive Tactics Instructor and was a senior officer during the officer \ninvolved shooting incident. My expectations would be that he is expected to know, \nfollow, and teach Use of Force Policy to the rest of the organization and lead by \nexample when working around younger officers. His rationale for his decision making \nhas come into question, especially during Use of Force incidents.  \n \nOfficer Arone violated the following rules and regulations: \n \n1.

GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  3\n47\n48\nA1:\nAnd this is William Baird of Mastagni Holstedt, representing Officer \n49\nArone. If, uh, I'd like to be able to just speak first if that's okay?\n50\n51\nQ:\nAbsolutely, yeah.\n52\n53\nA1:\nI know Officer Arone has some things he'd like to say as well. Um, the first \n54\nthing I'd like to say, and where I'm going to focus the majority of my remarks, \n55\nare on gonna be on the use of force because I understand, um, a sustained \n56\nfinding there or - or maintaining a sustained finding is - is problematic for a \n57\nnumber of reasons. But I think that, and I guess in preference, we're obviously \n58\nlooking for something not termination. Um, and - and so that's why I'm \n59\nstarting my remarks with this one, um, I think that if - if this were not \n60\nsustained or if it were exonerated or some other determination, um, it's easier \n61\nto move into a realm of something else besides a - a termination. I think that -\n62\n I think the finding that this was an unreasonable use of force that it was a \n63\nviolation of the use of force policy is a little bit, um, I think it can be made the \n64\nother way. I think there can be a finding that this was a reasonable use of \n65\nforce. While I still respect what seems to be the concern of both the \n66\ninvestigator and the department was which - which is that the force was not \n67\nnecessary. The investigator mentions that in his report on Page 44, um, where \n68\nhe says, \"The force used by Officer Arone was not necessary given the facts \n69\nand the totality of circumstances to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement \n70\npurpose.\" It's the second, uh, paragraph down or the first full paragraph I \n71\nguess. Um, that standard seems to be repeated in the Notice of Intent on Page \n72\n2. And I say seems to be, but it says, \"The force was not justified because the \n73\nsuspect was handcuffed, not resisting and was not disobeying any commands \n74\nthat he had been given.\" And I - I read that and - and my paraphrasing of that \n75\nis that because the suspect was handcuffed, in fact, handcuffed, and in fact, \n76\nnot resisting or I - I guess the determination may, not resisting and not \n77\ndisobeying any commands that therefore the force was not necessary. And - \n78\nand that standard appears to be repeated, again, on Page 5 of the Notice \n79\nof Intent, uh, under level of penalty, \"He engaged in an unnecessary use of \n80\nforce towards the suspect at Velvet dispensary, he was handcuffed and not \n81\nresisting any commands at the time you kneed him.\" And as I mentioned I - \n82\nI can certainly appreciate the concern the department has with, um, a use of \n83\nforce on someone who has been shot, was appeared to be complying, not \n84\nresisting and, um, and handcuffed. And in fact handcuffed, but the - the policy \n85\nreads a little bit differently, and it doesn't mandate that officers use force only \n86\nwhen necessary, but it requires the officers use reasonable force. And - \n87\nand that takes into account, uh, the facts known to or perceived by. And I \n88\nthink that's a really important word, uh, that perceived by the officer at the \n89\ntime of the event, and it considers the totality of circumstances. And the report \n90\nseems to concede that the circumstances were, uh, unquestionably chaotic and \n91\nstressful. And just to kind of give - to recap those, you know, there was - there \nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  4\n92\nhad just been an OIS. When Officer Arone arrived he didn't know the status of \n93\nwho had been shot, who had been not shot. Um, the vehicle had crashed. He \n94\nhad to break open a window because it wouldn't open on its own either \n95\nbecause the driver, as it turned out, had been shot or because they were not \n96\ncomplying with commands. A fire hydrant had been busted and there was \n97\nwater spraying in the air. It was the middle of the night. Their side curtain \n98\nairbags had deployed which prohibited Arone from being able to see inside \n99\nthe vehicle and figure out what was going on. There were commands being \n100\nshouted from multiple different officers at different unknown suspects. Arone \n101\ndescribed it as a stress level 12 out of ten, and he was able to get in there. \n102\nThere's officers yelling at one person to get out of the vehicle from the other \n103\nside, there's the driver who appeared to be deceased. Um, Arone tried to take \n104\nthe - open the door using his baton, I believe, and - and that snapped the door \n105\nhandle off. And so it was a - it was chaotic, it was stressful. Um, his position \n106\ndidn't allow him to fully see what was going on, on the other side of the \n107\nvehicle. And it didn't allow him to hear all the commands being given by the \n108\nother officers, such as, you know, get out of the vehicle. H- his position didn't \n109\nallow him, and he didn't perceive this person complying with officer \n110\ncommands to get out of the vehicle. What he perceived was this person exiting \n111\nthe - the, um, passenger side window. And I think that there was conversation \n112\nthere, at least it can be characterized - I'll characterize as, this person's going \n113\nout the window, um, of a vehicle, you know, he's either continuing to resist or \n114\nhe's being drug out because he's being resistive. And - and so those are the \n115\nthings that are kind of being perceived. And those perceptions are important \n116\nbecause, uh - oh, and then, you know, as he's moving around the vehicle, once \n117\nhe realizes this driver is deceased, he's moving around and can hear officers \n118\ncontinuing to shout commands. Uh, he can hear the suspect ye- yelling \n119\nsomething in return so at least there appears to be this verbal altercation going \n120\non, which is consistent with somebody who's resisting or continuing to be \n121\ncombative. One of the things that is noted in the report was that, um, of course \n122\nit said - the report says on Page 43, \"According to Officer Mendez, Wilson \n123\nwas not offering resistance quote, but was heavy.\" And then it continues, and \n124\nquote, \"Officer Arone said he perceived Wilson was, quote, dropping his \n125\nweight, and he considered that to be active resistance or non-compliance.\" \n126\nAnd - and I understand the report here is making a distinction between what \n127\none officer perceived and - and noted versus another one, but I don't read \n128\nthose as being inconsistent or mutually exclusive. So if I think one officer can \n129\nmaybe rightly know that the person wasn't, uh, resisting but was heavy, and \n130\nthat could be a fact, um, an accurate fact based on this one officer's better \n131\nperceptions and better knowledge of the incident, but it's not inconsistent with \n132\na separate officer arriving later and perceiving this person to be, you \n133\nknow, passively resisting or actively resisting by dropping his weight. Uh, \n134\nthey can feel the same if someone's being - if someone is in fact heavy or \n135\nsomeone is dropping their weight, it can feel the - the same. And so it's a \n136\nquestion of one - one officer's perceptions versus another one. Which the \nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  5\n137\nreason I said that, that perceptions is important because I think that a - a - \n138\na question or the way to filter this would be, you know what \n139\nOfficer Arone's perceptions are because he answered all of those questions \n140\nduring his - his IA. The question then becomes, were those perceptions \n141\nreasonable? And - and then if his perceptions were reasonable was the use of \n142\nforce based on those reasonable perceptions a reasonable use of force as \n143\nwell. And so whether - were those perceptions reasonable, I understand that \n144\nthe conclusion appears to be, from the investigation, that no they were \n145\nnot. The investigation notes that the fact that Wilson wasn't, this is again \n146\non Page 43, the - and it looks like after the interview portion, one, two, third \n147\nparagraph down, \"The fact that Wilson was in handcuffs should - should have \n148\nbeen apparent to Officer Arone by the way he was being dragged by Officer \n149\nMendez, parentheses, hands behind his back and being pulled under his arm.\" \n150\nThis sentence appears to be the - the sort of conclusion by the investigator \n151\nthat, um, Officer Arone's perceptions were not reasonable. But it's unclear \n152\nwhy this conclusion - how this conclusion was come to, or why this \n153\ninvestigator came to this conclusion. Um, it appears to be just the opinion of \n154\nthe - the investigator, who I'm - I'm sure is qualified, but I - I don't - I didn't \n155\nsee that any qualifications in here specifically as it might relate to this \n156\ninvestigator's, um, training on - on, you know, force, use of force science or, \n157\num, human performance factors relating to, um, the use of force. I think that, \n158\nyou know, if this were something that I, you know, I'll be kind of blunt and \n159\nhopefully in not a disrespectful way, but in a way that's meant to be, um, \n160\ncandid and, and - and frank, if I was going to - to litigate this, and - and if \n161\nI'm gonna be - if this were to go to a civil service commission hearing or an \n162\narbitration or something, I would have an expert that can review this who has \n163\nstudied use of force science, and - and they know the limitations of a person's \n164\nability to perceive, especially during stressful and chaotic situations. And I \n165\nwould expect that in that - in that review the conclusion that a number of use \n166\nof force experts, I don't think I would have to, you know, shop around for one \n167\nor anything, but I - I think that it wouldn't be a stretch to find one that would - \n168\nwould say yes in a - in a highly stressful situation, where all the factors that \n169\nI've already mentioned were happening and present, it's not unreasonable for \n170\nan officer's ability to perceive to be somewhat limited. I don't see that being \n171\nconsidered in this report. If it was - so and if it wasn't, I think it should be, \n172\nwhich is, I think, the point of this Skelly. So, um, I'm asking that - that this \n173\nsentence be reconsidered, um, the fact that Wilson was in handcuffs should \n174\nhave been apparent because I think it could very easily be written that it \n175\nshouldn't have be- that it - it was reasonable that it wasn't apparent. He was in \n176\na - it was night, it was a chaotic scene, he was in the sweatshirt. And I think \n177\nthat was mentioned, uh, in the notice as well. But I think that what hasn't been \n178\nconsidered, and the bigger point of what I'm trying to make, is the use of \n179\nforce the abil- a person's ability to perceive, in a highly stressful situation, \n180\nis gonna be impacted by essentially human limitations. So if, um, we consider \n181\nthat Officer Arone's perceptions, um, given the stressful event were \nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  6\n182\nreasonable then it becomes was his use of force based on those reasonable \n183\nperceptions. Re- and I'll say reasonable but inaccurate. I don't think anybody's \n184\ntrying to say that he was accurately perceiving anything that night because in \n185\nfact we all know that the person was in fact handcuffed and been shot and had \n186\ncome out of the car voluntarily by the point he was kneed. So, you know, was \n187\nhis perceptions, that were inaccurate, were they reasonable, and if they were \n188\nreasonable was the use of force reasonable. And I think that the answer to that \n189\nquestion is also a yes, because he perceives this guy as - as dropping his \n190\nweight and continuing to resist right after and prevent - and doing something \n191\nwith his weight and his hands to prevent him from being handcuffed. So he \n192\ndelivers two, uh, quick knee strikes to the head. And once he's able to perceive \n193\nthis guy as - as now being compliant, laying there, allowing himself to be \n194\nmanipulated and not be drug. We understand that he was being drugged \n195\npartially on his own will and in response to officer commands, but that's again \n196\nnot how it was being perceived to Arone at the time. This is where that sort of \n197\nmistaken but reasonable perception comes into play. You know so was he -\n198\n and that's when he stopped. And was that sort of minimal use of force \n199\nreasonable I would say yes as well. And when that kind of analysis is \n200\ndone, and those factors are considered, I think that's how you can take this \n201\nfrom a - a case where you have a sustained use of force to, um, I would say an \n202\nexonerated use of force, understanding that - that it's based on, um, inaccurate \n203\nperceptions, inaccurate but reasonable perceptions, from Officer Arone. And \n204\nif you're able to take out that use of force from being sustained, then we're left \n205\nwith - with other allegations being sustained, which I don't think merit a \n206\ntermination. The first that I'll talk about, and - and really the only one that \n207\nI'm gonna talk at any sort of length about, is going to be the reporting of the \n208\nuse of force that was noted as, um, not being seen on - on body-worn camera. \n209\nI didn't see it on body-worn camera either. Um, but Officer Arone did have a - \n210\na pretty strong recollection about the circumstances in which he had reported \n211\nthat on the scene. And, um, you know, he - he remembers the response he was \n212\ngiven at the time. And I understand there was a little bit of a conflict \n213\nthere, um, with I believe it was, uh, Sergeant Espinoza.\n214\n215\nQ:\nYes, sir.\n216\n217\nA1:\nAnd I believe there was a little bit of conflict because, Espinoza, Sergeant \n218\nEspinoza says that he didn't hear that, and that had he heard that he would \n219\nhave taken some certain actions consistent with policy. But I think that, um, \n220\nyou know, while I - I don't think anybody's being dishonest, I think \n221\npeople have, um, are - are unable to remember certain things in a stressful \n222\nsituation. And I think perhaps it's the situation where Sergeant Espinoza didn't \n223\nremember, um, being told that either. And - and I think why would that be the \n224\ncase, aside from stressful events affecting people's ability to remember things? \n225\nWell, I do think that's the reason, but another way that Sergeant Espinoza, I \n226\ndon't think had a great memory on this point, was in, uh, Page 11 through 13 \nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  7\n227\nof his transcript. He's being asked about, um, Arone documenting the use of \n228\nforce in his report and whether, um, Sergeant Espinoza had read that in the \n229\nreport. And he essentially, I'm summing this part up, but I've given you the \n230\nportion of the interview where it's discussed, so you can read more later, but \n231\nhe says that he doesn't remember seeing that in - in the report. And the \n232\ninvestigator kind of says, \"Well, you know, you're aware that there's audit \n233\ntrails on viewing these reports right? And would it be surprising to you if you \n234\nwere showing up on these audit trails?\" And Espinoza essentially says, \"Yes,\" \n235\nwhich is a concession that he's not remembering, um, having actually \n236\nreviewed it. So there is some evidence in the file about Espinoza being aware \n237\nof this, but then not remembering it later, which is, again, I'm not saying any - \n238\ndue to any dishonesty on Sergeant Espinoza's part, but what I am saying is \n239\nwhen a stressful event like this happens, everybody's doing their best and \n240\ntrying to follow all the different protocols and rules and procedures that are in \n241\nplace and sometimes people, you know, they're so focused on thing number A \n242\nthat they're not getting to thing number M or letter M. And so I think that, you \n243\nknow, when you have an example like this where Sergeant Espinoza is \n244\ndocumented, I think, somewhat proven that he had seen something, learned \n245\nabout something, and didn't remember it later you have the same situation \n246\nnow here where there's a question of whether he was told something on scene \n247\nor not. He's saying that he didn't, but what we're saying is perhaps that he was, \n248\nand he just doesn't remember it, just like he learned about the use of force by \n249\nviewing the report as part of the review process but didn't remember that. And \n250\nif you consider that that's a possibility then I think that it at least mitigates the \n251\nreporting on the use of force pretty heavily because while I understand that \n252\nthere were time within that 30-minute video that's caught on body-worn \n253\ncamera for Officer Arone to have reported that use of force, and the fact that \n254\nhe didn't do it for 30 minutes may still be unacceptable to you - to you \n255\nunderstand that completely, but it is mitigated in any event that he's saying \n256\nthat he eventually did say something while on scene albeit maybe too late. But \n257\nif he did, he's - he's still saying it and so that can be - that can be addressed \n258\nwith a correction rather than a - a termination and loss of a career. As for, \n259\num, the other allegations, which sort of revolve - involved the knife, um, \n260\nI'm gonna let Officer Arone talk a little bit more about that. But I - I think \n261\nwhat he's going to say is that he understands how that looks. He understands \n262\nthat that's not acceptable. He understands that, um, although there was no ill \n263\nintent or anything there, he doesn't want to - he, you know, he doesn't want to \n264\n- he understands how reputations are made, and he doesn't want, uh, to go \n265\ndown that road and - and have that reputation. And if he's allowed to be able \n266\nto come back, he's gonna do everything he can to - to earn it and to ma- re-\n267\nearn, or earn, and maintain, uh, your trust going forward. And that's what I \n268\nhave to say. That was a lot. Thank you for listening. I'll - I'll let sergeant Ar- \n269\nor Officer Arone talk now. \n270\nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  8\n271\nA:\nUm, just, like, today marks 140 days since I've been put on here. Um, so 140 \n272\ndays I've - I've had to kind of mull over this all, look at the man in the mirror \n273\nlisten to the walls talk to you for a while, you know, and - and kind of replay \n274\neverything in my head. Uh, I think most importantly, or - or, uh, foremost I \n275\nwant to start with, I - I did not know the suspect was handcuffed, let alone \n276\nshot at that time. Um, with the luxury of hindsight being 20/20 I can look back \n277\nand say, you know, clearly that a suspect who was handcuffed and - and shot \n278\ndid not need to be kneed. Uh, but my perceptions at the time, trying to do the \n279\nbest I could under the chaotic circumstances, uh, is kind of what unfolded. But \n280\nI - I again did not know the suspect was handcuffed more than I know he was \n281\nshot or that wouldn't have happened. Um, I love being a police officer in the \n282\ncity, especially this community. Uh, credibility can take a lifetime to build \n283\nright in an instant to - to - to go away. Uh, I think that's one of the biggest \n284\nstruggles I've dealt with is that - that, you know, my - I know that my moral \n285\ncompass, my ethical compass points north, that I'm not somebody who's a \n286\nshady person or trying to hide things. In regards to the knife, I understand the \n287\noptics of that. Uh, it was a lapse in judgment at the time because my mind was \n288\nso focused elsewhere on other things at the time of the scene, um, but that's \n289\nnot who Giani Arone is. That's not the officer I want to be or the person I've \n290\nbeen trained to be or the person that goes out there and represents this \n291\ndepartment. Um, I - I own wholeheartedly that I could have done something \n292\ndifferently or I should have made better judgment at the time, um, so I'm not \n293\ndisputing that at all. But, um, I - I, uh, oh of course I - I - again, I think just the \n294\n- the - of all these things combined I think the - the biggest thing was my \n295\nperceptions at the time I didn't know that he was handcuffed, I didn't know \n296\nthat he was shot. We'd had a conversation relatively recently before this that \n297\nwas still at the forefront of my mind. I took to heart everything you said. Um, \n298\nand so it wasn't - this wasn't some kind of, you know, I don't know the word \n299\nI'm trying to use here, I - I - this was all because of the perceptions I had at the \n300\ntime is the was the way that it unfolded. It wasn't any kind of, you \n301\nknow, gratuitous thing or anything of that nature. Um, again, I know that my -\n302\n morally that - that I try and represent myself and this department the best way \n303\nI can when I go out there. And these circumstances, had they been different, \n304\nthings would have gone differently, but, uh, it was a perfect storm. It was a \n305\nchaotic scene and my perceptions, uh, I did the best I could at the time with \n306\nwhat I was perceiving. Um, I think that's more or less, without talking your \n307\nears off, more or less the message I wanted to convey.\n308\n309\nQ:\nWhat do you guys, uh, it feels as if - what's your opinion on an appropriate, \n310\nuh, penalty level?\n311\n312\nA1:\nI think Officer Arone is understanding that, um, there are aspects to this that \n313\nhe could have done better, and he understands and wants to do better. He's \n314\nwilling to accept correction, and he's willing to accept, I - I think, a suspension \n315\nup to 30 days. And I don't think, well, I can make a representation that a \nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  9\n316\nsuspension of 30 days would not be appealed if the use of force is changed, \n317\nthe actual use as well the - the actual use of force, that is, um...\n318\n319\nQ:\nI had a question for you, uh, you had mentioned on that, uh, you were, \n320\nuh, making a legal argument about, um, a dispute between what's in the notice \n321\nand then in terms of the review. And obviously I get that, uh, you know, any \n322\nuse of force, uh, can't be evaluated with 20/20 hindsight, I understand that \n323\nconcept. Um, but you had raised about that somewhere you had read that it's \n324\nonly that the force is reasonable and not necessary. And I was curious to your \n325\nrelationship with that, and 835A, which is cited in here, and the policy, which \n326\nsays that to use reaso- force that reasonably appears necessary given the facts \n327\nand totality.\n328\n329\nA1:\nRight. And I think that's what, I apologize for not making that clearer. Um, it's \n330\nthat word appears that reasonably appears necessary, or I guess the two words \n331\nreasonably appears necessary, which is why I was trying to talk about how I \n332\nthink that the - the proper lens is not what the facts actually were, although \n333\nthat can be considered in evaluating Arone's perceptions and determining \n334\nwhether they were reasonable or not. But the - the, I think, appropriate lens to \n335\nview this through is what was Officer Arone perceiving. And then I think you \n336\nhave to ask were those perceptions reasonable because that's that part right \n337\nhere where it says reasonably appears. Of course the actual facts matter \n338\nbecause, you know, you take somebody who's for example sitting handcuffed \n339\non a sidewalk in broad view not doing anything and - and if somebody were to \n340\nrun up take a running start and knee that person in the head with nothing \n341\naround nothing going on that's can't reasonably be perceived by anybody to be \n342\nreasonable or necessary to do anything right, but that's not really the situation \n343\nhere because there's a whole lot of other factors. And there are the totality of \n344\ncircumstances that are perceived by the officer which include, you know, the \n345\nfact this guy's exiting out the other side of the vehicle, that he was at least -\n346\n while he's being handcuffed on the ground was out of sight from Arone, that \n347\nthere was yelling happening at the time, um, consistent with somebody who's \n348\ncontinuing to struggle and resist. Those are the facts that are being perceived \n349\nby Arone at the time. And so his conclusion, when he comes around the \n350\nvehicle, sees this person, I guess, being drug, I'd have to look at the exact \n351\nlanguage that was used when he was being questioned about that, but sees this \n352\nperson being moved by officers, or in the process of being detained it \n353\nappeared to him, was his use of force - did his - was his use of \n354\nforce reasonably necessary to help get this person detained? And it presents \n355\nthis interesting concept of, well, factually he was already detained, but that \n356\nwasn't known to Arone at the time that he did that he executed the knee \n357\nstrikes.\n358\n359\nQ:\nUm, in - in reading the, uh, the interview, and I - I appreciate the - and \n360\nunderstand the argument in terms of his actions based upon what he knew at \nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  10\n361\nthe time versus us looking back now. And so even if it was a \n362\nmistake and fact was it reasonable for him to have that...\n363\n364\nA1:\nYes.\n365\n366\nQ:\n...uh, mistake of fact in terms of not recognizing at the moment that uses about \n367\nwhether or not he was in - in handcuffs. But one of the challenges is \n368\ndetermining what, assuming that he didn't know, uh, tha- in other words that \n369\nhe was unhandcuffed, and then the knee strikes are delivered, but then there's \n370\nno real indication in terms of what that effort was to do, uh, like, what the - \n371\nthe lawful basis was. So the knee strikes are delivered, and then what, what's \n372\nthe - the goal of that force was never clear to me in terms of the - the interview \n373\nthat was done. So I don't know - do you have a - an argument on that in terms \n374\nof what - what that was about? And - and if initially - so I think a two part \n375\nquestion is what that was about? And then the second part is that if initially it \n376\nwasn't realized he was in handcuffs, that once you deliver those knee \n377\nstrikes then at - at some point, a reasonable officer I think would be expected \n378\nto determine that the person is in fact handcuffed and maybe go, \"Oh, my \n379\ngosh I didn't realize that,\" or something like that effect.\n380\n381\nA1:\nSure. Uh, and I - I - I think, and - and what I'd be willing to do if - if it would \n382\nbe, you know, I'm - I'm fine to relook over the - the interview and provide \n383\nsomething in writing that points out later, if you'd like. My memory is that he \n384\nstated he used, and I can't point to this exactly because I didn't know this \n385\nquestion was coming necessarily, but he did e- execute the knee strikes to \n386\nassist with putting the person in handcuffs, with detaining him. When I \n387\nwatched the video and I, between the video and - and the overall interview, \n388\nwhat I'm seeing is he delivers the knee strikes and that's when the person has \n389\nfinished being moved and now is, like, laying there prone not - not moving, \n390\nnot struggling, really kind of can't because he's handcuffed, but he's - he's not -\n391\n he's not moving around to the point where he needs to be controlled anymore. \n392\nAnd that's when you see Officer Arone kind of at the head and looking away \n393\nwhile the other officer moves up, which I would say would be consistent with \n394\nanother officer putting handcuffs on this person. And that's when that stopped, \n395\nthat's when - and - but Arone's looking away from the person. He's looking -\n396\n he's not looking back to where the hands are to see oh he's already been \n397\nhandcuffed, he's looking at the opposite direction.\n398\n399\nQ:\nDo you have any statement regarding the lack of any commands prior to the \n400\nknee strike for dropping weight?\n401\n402\nA1:\nMy, again, my - my comment on that, from having looked at the reports and \n403\neverything or - and - and interviews, was that it was a - a very rapidly \n404\nunfolding situation, and the need to get compliance outweighed the - the need \nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  11\n405\nto, you know, give commands and wait and see if there's going to be, \n406\nuh, compliance lines with the commands.\n407\n408\nQ:\nUm, the comment, uh, \"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes,\" what was that \n409\nin reference to?\n410\n411\nA:\nSo I do remember saying that, Chief. And what that was is, if I, and my \n412\nrecollection the best I could recall was, it was when one of the medics had \n413\nalready treated, um, Mr. Wilson was the one that survived, correct? Mr. \n414\nWilson, they treated him already. Then he asked me about the - the driver, \n415\nwhat's going on with the driver. And I think at that point I said he was either, \n416\nhe's either dead or he was shot in the head or something to that effect. Then \n417\nMr. Wilson had said something like, \"Oh, you MFers killed my brother,\" \n418\nsomething like that. And then so it was, again, was it maybe not appropriate at \n419\nthe time to say, sure, but it was kind of like, \"Well, you play stupid games, \n420\nyou win stupid prizes,\" in regards to his brother being shot and killed. And \n421\nafter, you know, um, the best I could recall, that's what it was.\n422\n423\nQ:\nDid...\n424\n425\nA:\n...it wasn't directed at, Mr. Wilson, like, \"Hey, you, sir, this is your \n426\npunishment.\" It was like, \"Hey, your brother, yeah, well, your brother got shot \n427\nbecause he tried to run over police officers,\" and ...\n428\n429\nQ:\nIt wasn't in reference to the force against...\n430\n431\nA:\nNo, not at all. It was - and that's why I - I - I actually did mention that at one \n432\npoint that day. It read in - in this that it would look like almost like a standing \n433\nover somebody after, you know, you make a big play or something \n434\nlike, \"Oh, yeah, take that.\" That wasn't the - the - the - the purpose of that. \n435\nThat was more, as I was talking to the firefighter, he heard me say that his \n436\nbrother, or whoever it was, is dead, or shot. He made the remark of like, \"Oh, \n437\nwell, you guys killed my brother.\" Well, he did just try and run over and \n438\nkill a police officers, so stupid game, stupid prizes. Again, appropriate, \n439\nprobably not. But, um, it wasn't at Mr. Wilson as a - as a dig at him, it was a \n440\ncomment regarding why his brother ended up shot.\n441\n442\nQ:\nUm, I think we all recognize that - that hindsight's always a lot clearer than - \n443\nthan something in the moment, but...\n444\n445\nA:\nYes, sir.\n446\n447\nQ:\n...one, um, one question I had was, you - you had mentioned on the - \n448\nthe events subsequent to the use of force that related to the whole knife \n449\nincident and so forth, you said, well, I think the, and I - and I, correct me if I'm \nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  12\n450\noff on the wording, but I think you said, like, \"Well, I could have done some \n451\ndifferent things or whatever else.\" But, uh, one of the things I wonder is, is it \n452\nthat you could have done some different things or you should have done some \n453\ndifferent things?\n454\n455\nA:\nUh, both, should have I think is the more important one, should have done \n456\nthings differently, but I - I guess in hindsight looking back it was, you know, \n457\num, and like we say, you know, in hindsight it's so easy to sit back, and think \n458\noh I should have done this I should have done this. So I guess the - the - \n459\nthe term should have been should have is - is the term I should have used... \n460\n461\nQ:\nSo...\n462\n463\nA:\n...should have…\n464\n465\nQ:\n...um, you're obviously both arguing from different, uh, you \n466\nknow, positions so to speak of sort of a, um, the mind and, I think, the heart \n467\nargument to an extent of reducing this to something, uh, different than - \n468\nthan termination. Um, how - so part of a police officer's job, uh, is to make \n469\nappropriate decisions in very difficult situations, um, and miscalculations in \n470\nthose things, while certainly in some cases may even be legally justified, can \n471\ncreate liability for the city and so forth, get other people hurt, that sort of \n472\nthing. Uh, what I haven't heard is how, you - you mentioned a little bit \n473\nabout you've had a lot of time to think about things and stuff like this, but \n474\nwhat assurances, both realized in this case, and what's cited in the Notice \n475\nof Intent of, um, the prior case, that we would have some level of assurance \n476\nthat a situation wouldn't reoccur and then the same, uh, rationale as offers, \n477\nwell it's an intense situation, and, uh, you know, I could have should have \n478\nwould have type thing, like, what - what would we have going forward? And -\n479\n and I do want to acknowledge, and I think the investigator acknowledges, \n480\nand I acknowledge, that this situation, uh, was out of the norm for the city of \n481\nMartinez, uh, in terms of an officer involved shooting not happening I think \n482\nfor 15 years, um, and really not responding to those type of incidents on any \n483\nsort of regular basis. I just want to throw that out there, but, um, or \n484\nacknowledge that. But going forward what - how would we have that \n485\nassurance to know that these things don't happen and that there's some beyond \n486\ndiscipline?\n487\n488\n489\nA1:\nI'll say, and I - I don't know that you're gonna like my answer necessarily, but \n490\nit's, uh, I've thought a lot about that right, because I - I think it's an extremely -\n491\n it's a very reasonable thing to want to know. And - and a majority of the time \n492\nwhen - when we're in here doing Skelly hearings we want to make sure we're \n493\ncommunicating, here's our plan so that this never happens again. It's a - it's a - \n494\nit's a little bit of the playbook so to speak from - from where we sit. What \nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  13\n495\nmakes it difficult in this situation is, is I don't know that - I don't know that \n496\nthere's something we can say ki- because of the nature of this. You know, I \n497\nthink that it's - if we were to say that, you know, here's - here's our suggestions \n498\nfor how this wouldn't happen again I think it almost - it a little bit undercuts \n499\nwhat we're trying to say because it makes it - because we'd - on the one hand \n500\nwe'd be saying there are factors that are outside of our control yet here's how \n501\nwe can control them going forward. You know, I mean the - the sort of nature \n502\nof being human is that we're - we're limited on certain things on what we can \n503\nprocess. And - and so how can we get better at - at maximizing our ability to \n504\nperceive under stressful events is, I think, one of those challenges that's a bit \n505\nbeyond, you know, that ability - our ability to - to solve. To the extent that we \n506\ndon't want to be helpless, and we want to take some control over things, I \n507\nthink that there are, I mean, I think we're open to really anything. If there are \n508\nways to put someone through training to improve their ability to perceive \n509\nunder stressful environments, I think that would be welcome. But I think that \n510\npolice agencies all over the country are wanting to do that, because they \n511\nrealize that the better officers are able to, you know, the better able officers \n512\nin perceiving and reacting to events, esp- esp- especially under stressful \n513\nsituations, the better the community served by that police force, the better the \n514\n- the, you know, everybody is from a - a reduction of risk standpoint, um, ad \n515\neverything else. But I think that that's a - a really tough question to ask when \n516\nit's sort of based on the - the sort of essence of being human, which is, you \n517\nknow, there's limited ability just given our - our the humanity that we have. I \n518\nhope that makes sense.\n519\n520\nQ:\nI - I think on count or ground number one, in terms of use of force, I \n521\nunderstand what you're saying. Um, but there's also other significant ones that \n522\nhappen afterwards. Um, and I'll tell you, like, the incongruent behavior is that \n523\nright before the, we'll call it the knife component, um, you know, individuals \n524\nasked to, uh, to turn off cameras. And Officer Arone said, he (unintelligible) \n525\nI guess.\n526\n527\nQ1:\nYeah.\n528\n529\nQ:\nYeah, uh, they asked to turn off cameras, right? And Officer Arone said, \"No, \n530\nyou need to talk to a sergeant.\" But then, you know, and I don't remember the \n531\nexact time, but a few minutes later we then end up with what formulates the \n532\nbasis for these other incidents occurring. And I hear like, well, thinking back \n533\nor whatever else, but that wasn't in the midst of the stuff. It was in the overall \n534\nincident. And so trying to wrap my head around understanding is it how could \n535\nwe be assured that, you know, this happened to be caught on camera and so \n536\nforth. And I think by your own argument, like, reporting to the supervisor you \n537\ncan see that, if that happened in the way that he remembers, it happened off \n538\ncamera, uh, which didn't serve him or the department very well and was \n539\notherwise not documented. So if you can talk about that.\nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  14\n540\n541\nA1:\nSure, and I appreciate having the opportunity to talk about two different things \n542\nbecause I do think they are different, and I appreciate you understanding and \n543\nlimiting my - my sort of...\n544\n545\nA:\nYes, sir.\n546\n547\nA1:\n...attributing it only to that first part, which is, it's of course intended to \n548\nbecause there are a bunch of things that happen afterwards, which, you \n549\nknow, uh, can be addressed as well. You know, one of the district attorneys I - \n550\nI learned from in - in Colorado, he talked about, and he was one of the \n551\npioneers of body-worn cameras for officers. And back when that first was \n552\nhappening, he said, \"Sunlight's the best disinfectant.\" And that idea is not \n553\nunique to him or to, you know, or it's not earth-shattering either. I believe \n554\nthat I think Officer Arone believes that as well. Um, I think those policies that \n555\nhave body-worn camera, you know, keeping them on and capturing that is \n556\nbeneficial for the reasons that you mentioned and - and reasons that we're all \n557\nfamiliar with. As for how can you be assured that this isn't going to happen \n558\nagain from Officer Arone, I think he's a better person that can answer that \n559\nrather than me. He can tell you a little bit about how he wants to be perceived \n560\nif he's allowed to come back and what this, you know, what, I guess, integrity \n561\nmeans to him. I'll let him answer that.\n562\n563\nA:\nYeah, Chief, and just to touch on what he said, I think if I am allowed to come \n564\nback, and I'm allowed to stay here, um, I understand that I have a hill like this \n565\nto climb. I understand that, you know, I'll be under a microscope where all \n566\neyes will be on me. Um, and if I, one, didn't think that it was something I \n567\ncould rise to the occasion of I - I wouldn't be here fighting for a job that I love. \n568\nI wouldn't be making assurances that things like this wouldn't happen. Again, \n569\nI - I mentioned that today's 140 days, that's 140 days that I've, every single \n570\nday I walk by here. Every day I - I sit and watch my daughter. Every day I - \n571\nI stay awake at night. It's - it's, you know, looking introspectively at myself. \n572\nUm, seeing the words termination on a - on a piece of paper for a career that \n573\nyou love have - have rocked my foundation maybe in, um, maybe a good way. \n574\nIn - in that being able to it's rocked my foundation in that be more, I guess \n575\nwhat am I trying to say, bear with me I'm trying to put my...\n576\n577\nQ:\nSure.\n578\n579\nA:\n...my - my mouth is going before my thoughts are finished. I recognize the \n580\nthings that I should have done better. Um, and again it's - it's easy to sit here \n581\nin - in hindsight and say differently. But I think this whole experience has - \n582\nhas shown me a lot in - in that - that, you know, I wish there was a word that I \n583\ncould say that this is the assurances, and it's right here this gold card, but the \n584\nassurance is this - this -this whole time off to sit here and think about it, this - \nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  15\n585\nthis facing this possible termination has - has -has taken that - the de- desired \n586\neffect I guess so to speak in that going forward, you know, using better \n587\njudgment in - in - in moments, even stressful moments, or - or, uh, taking \n588\nprecautions to make sure keeping the camera on from - from day to night, \n589\nwhatever the case may be, you know what I mean? But I - I - I don't have one \n590\nspecific word that I think of this as my golden ticket that - that I have on - \n591\non paper. But I think this whole experience, and this whole 140 days of - \n592\nof introspectively looking back at things, um, I punish myself more than \n593\nanybody else can punish me. Uh, the word termination isn't even the worst \n594\npunishment that could be given, I think it's myself and - and the - the - the -\n595\n my credibility being questioned and things of that nature. Um, I've beaten \n596\nmyself up plenty over that. And so while I don't have, again, one phrase that - \n597\nthat I think would be the, this is the magic phrase, I think this is definitely put \n598\nthings into perspective.\n599\n600\nQ:\nUm, and looking through anything, obviously, there's a couple, uh, lenses to \n601\nlook at. There's obviously you involved, there's the rest of the department, \n602\nthere's also the community.\n603\n604\nA:\nYes, sir.\n605\n606\nQ:\nUm, you mentioned 140 days, obviously, of impact to you.\n607\n608\nA:\nRight.\n609\n610\nQ:\nUm, but it's 140 days impact too to the community of not having, you \n611\nknow, an officer out there to serve...\n612\n613\nA:\nYes, sir. \n614\n615\nQ:\n...which I realize the decision to place you out and not doing that is not yours, \n616\nbut you have a role in the conduct that led up to...\n617\n618\nA:\nYes, sir.\n619\n620\nQ:\n...that decision. And then of course to, uh, the peers and - and, you know, \n621\nchronologically following another, uh, incident. I realize this one's a little bit \n622\ndifferent because timing of things, um, but, uh, that's something else to - to - \n623\nto consider and really considering is the - the, uh, the impact not only this has, \n624\nbut then to, uh, you know, a likelihood of if - if reoccurrence happened, what \n625\nthat impact would be to, uh, the community. And on any front of \n626\nthese because I think that the use of force is, um, is a very serious component \n627\nof it...\n628\n629\nA:\nYes, sir.\nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  16\n630\n631\nQ:\n...but I also think the other ones are equally very important. And - \n632\nand particularly, I think, as you both acknowledged, uh, not only the - \n633\nthe actual impact of, uh, you know, the - the knife component, but literally the \n634\nvisual optics of what's seen...\n635\n636\nA:\nSure.\n637\n638\nQ:\n...on camera. And - and some of which I acknowledge that you didn't at the \n639\ntime have knowledge of - how it would have played out, but you now see how \n640\nthe pieces all...\n641\n642\nA:\nYes, sir.\n643\n644\nQ:\n...fold together, and you're inextricably linked, um, you know...\n645\n646\nA:\nYes, sir.\n647\n648\nQ:\n...to - to that within there. Did you have anything?\n649\n650\nQ1:\nNo.\n651\n652\nQ:\nDo you have anything that - other that you would like to add?\n653\n654\nA1:\nYou know, you identified kind of what we were doing here, right, which is I'm \n655\naddressing it from a more legal and - and sort of logical type of argument, \n656\nand I'm leaving the part that's relating to how this has affected him and what \n657\nthis means to him, for him to talk about, because I think it maximizes the \n658\neffectiveness of both. You know, however, being an attorney, and somebody \n659\nwho, um, like it or not, I'm - I'm fairly skilled with words and language I - \n660\nI don't really have trouble communicating things in the way that a lot of \n661\npeople might have trouble communicating. So the only thing I would ask, in \n662\naddition for you to consider, would be something that, if I may add on for \n663\nwhat he's saying, and I think he said, but perhaps can be expressed in a little \n664\nbit different way, which is, he's - he's talked about one thing he just said that I \n665\nthink is really powerful, Arone has said that's very powerful, has been \n666\ntermination's not even the - the worst thing on here it's really about that hit to \n667\nhis credibility. And I know that I've talked with him, and he's expressed this to \n668\nme, and I hope that it's come across to you that, you know, credibility and \n669\nintegrity are kind of those things that - were you gonna say something, I'm \n670\nsorry?\n671\n672\nQ:\nNo, no. I was taking a break.\n673\nINTERVIEW WITH OFC. GIANI ARONE\nInterviewer: Chief Andrew White\n01-12-24/1:02 pm\nCase # IA23-07 / IA23-08\nPage  17\n674\nA1:\nThey are - they are things that he, as Officer Arone said, they take a - \n675\na lifetime to build and an instant to lose. Um, and I think that he understands \n676\nthat this is not, um, the decision-making here was not what it should have \n677\nbeen that he should have definitely done something different. That the fact \n678\nthat he didn't do something different, and that he did what he did has affected \n679\nhis credibility and his - the way he's viewed. Um, I think if people, um, and - \n680\nand that's not something that can be fixed by putting him back to work and \n681\nhaving him show at the right place in the right uniform, that takes doing that \n682\nday in day out. And then every time that you're faced with one of those \n683\nquestions about what am I going to do, am I going to turn the camera off or \n684\nam I gonna leave it on, you leave it on. Am I gonna stay and take this extra \n685\nreport or am I gonna call it good with just those statements I got? You know, \n686\nand I think being com- what he didn't maybe explain for, you know, in - in \n687\ndetail, but what I hope has come across in spirit, has been he understands that \n688\nit's going to take that work to rebuild that - that trust and rebuild that \n689\ncredibility but that he's willing to do it. Correct me if I said that wrong.\n690\n691\nA:\nYeah, no, I did. I think you said that exactly. Sometimes I can stumble over \n692\nmy words a little bit, and I'm not as articulate, and especially when there's a \n693\nlot of emotion behind it but, uh, it's essentially exactly what I was trying to \n694\nconvey.\n695\n696\nA1:\nSo, as for assurances, where does that come from? And I think it comes from \n697\nhearing that this matters to him as a person, and that this is more than just a \n698\njob. That this is sort of, he doesn't want to be seen as a person that doesn't \n699\nhave credibility, or he doesn't want to be seen as somebody who is anything \n700\nless than completely trustworthy.\n701\n702\nQ:\nUnderstood. Anything else?\n703\n704\nA1:\nNo, sir.\n705\n706\nQ:\nAll, right.\n707\n708\n709\nThe transcript has been reviewed with the audio recording submitted and it is an accurate \n710\ntranscription.\n711\nSigned: ______________________________________________________",

The suspect attempted to discard the \ncontraband and flee the area in spite of the officer’s obvious status as law enforcement, and their \nlawful order to stop. Officer Miller had probable cause to arrest the suspect, and he was justified in \npursuing, and physically restraining him. \n \nFrom there, the suspect’s sudden resistance to Officer Miller’s attempts to handcuff him, \naccompanied by his agitated and repeated references to a “gun,” created a need to respond with \nphysical force. \n \nWhen officers are determining whether to apply force, and what force option to use, they must take \nthe totality of the circumstances into consideration. \n \nIn this situation, several factors applied when the decision to use force was made. \n1. The suspects sudden efforts to physically resist being handcuffed. \n2. The suspect’s apparent agitation. \n3. The potential effects of drugs or alcohol on the subject’s behavior. \n4. The suspect’s mental state and his ability to perceive commands. \n5. The suspect’s references to a gun, accompanied by a move toward his own waistband. \n6. The potential for injury to officers or other members of the public. \n7. Proximity of weapons or dangerous devices. Not only what the suspect may possess, but \nweapons officers are equipped with that the suspect could potentially gain access to. \n8. The degree of to which the suspect has been restrained and his ability to resist despite \nbeing restrained. \n \nUnder these circumstances, Officer Miller’s perception of a significant threat, and a need to take \ndecisive action was reasonable. Based on that perception, he applied force to control and restrain \nthe suspect by wrapping his arms around the suspect’s body and arms and lifting and throwing the \nsuspect to the ground. By wrapping his arms around the suspect’s body and arms, it pinned the \nsuspect’s arms to his own body preventing the suspect’s ability to access a weapon. By lifting the \nsuspect, it removed the suspect’s ability to maintain his balance and remain on his feet where he \nwould be in a better position to further resist. Throwing the suspect to the ground allowed Officer \nMiller to put the suspect in a position of disadvantage so he could control and restrain him. \n \nIt is important to note that Officer Miller’s choice of method he used to neutralize the threat and \nestablish immediate control of the suspect was the necessary product of a split-second decision in \na tense, and rapidly evolving situation. \n \nIt is also important to note that force was immediately discontinued after initial takedown and the \nresistance stopped.  Officers recognized that the suspect was incapacitated, and immediately took \nsteps to address his medical needs. \n \n \nThe findings of this investigation are that the use of force utilized during this incident was both \nwithin the law and SRPD policy. \n \nRecommendations: \n \n \n1. Early and immediate suspect control of the suspect will potentially limit the amount \nof force needed in an incident: \na. If an officer who is making a lawful detention and arrest is encountering a suspect \nwho is already resisting a control hold, using a more secure technique may result \nin an overall lower frequency and level of force used. Additionally, evaluation and \nreview of “contact and cover” concepts to utilize both officers to establish early \ncontrol of a suspect to prevent further resistance. The secondary officer should \nconsider assisting the primary officer with physical control to reduce the chances \nof resistance.  \n \n2. Implement increased and focused training on takedown techniques and control \nholds with attention to the environment of the incident: \na. The use of force was within law and policy, however, a number of techniques can \nbe reviewed and trained to decrease the potential for injury in cases such as these. \nWith earlier and better control of the arms and wrists, a number of techniques \nincluding arm bars and leg sweeps may be available to the officer. Training for \nthese situations and techniques would prevent an officer from lifting the suspect \nfrom the ground and taking them to the ground which has the potential for \nincreased injury to both the suspect and the officer.   \n \n3. Use of Force Review Board: \na. Discuss implementation of a Use of Force Review Board with the Professional \nStandards section of SRPD to create an additional layer of review to analyze \nincidents such as this for recommendations of actions.  Part of this review would \ninclude identifying ways to lessen injury to both community members and officers. \n \n4. After Action Review with involved officers: \na. Review the above findings and recommendations with Sgt Barrett, Officer Miller, \nand Officer Laron to improve effectiveness, improve officer safety, and reduce \ninjuries to both officers and members of the public.",

Officer Miller had probable cause to arrest the suspect, and he was justified in \npursuing, and physically restraining him. \n \nFrom there, the suspect’s sudden resistance to Officer Miller’s attempts to handcuff him, \naccompanied by his agitated and repeated references to a “gun,” created a need to respond with \nphysical force. \n \nWhen officers are determining whether to apply force, and what force option to use, they must take \nthe totality of the circumstances into consideration. \n \nIn this situation, several factors applied when the decision to use force was made. \n1. The suspects sudden efforts to physically resist being handcuffed. \n2. The suspect’s apparent agitation. \n3. The potential effects of drugs or alcohol on the subject’s behavior. \n4. The suspect’s mental state and his ability to perceive commands. \n5. The suspect’s references to a gun, accompanied by a move toward his own waistband. \n6. The potential for injury to officers or other members of the public. \n7. Proximity of weapons or dangerous devices. Not only what the suspect may possess, but \nweapons officers are equipped with that the suspect could potentially gain access to. \n8. The degree of to which the suspect has been restrained and his ability to resist despite \nbeing restrained. \n \nUnder these circumstances, Officer Miller’s perception of a significant threat, and a need to take \ndecisive action was reasonable. Based on that perception, he applied force to control and restrain \nthe suspect by wrapping his arms around the suspect’s body and arms and lifting and throwing the \nsuspect to the ground. By wrapping his arms around the suspect’s body and arms, it pinned the \nsuspect’s arms to his own body preventing the suspect’s ability to access a weapon. By lifting the \nsuspect, it removed the suspect’s ability to maintain his balance and remain on his feet where he \nwould be in a better position to further resist. Throwing the suspect to the ground allowed Officer \nMiller to put the suspect in a position of disadvantage so he could control and restrain him. \n \nIt is important to note that Officer Miller’s choice of method he used to neutralize the threat and \nestablish immediate control of the suspect was the necessary product of a split-second decision in \na tense, and rapidly evolving situation. \n \nIt is also important to note that force was immediately discontinued after initial takedown and the \nresistance stopped.  Officers recognized that the suspect was incapacitated, and immediately took \nsteps to address his medical needs. \n \n \nThe findings of this investigation are that the use of force utilized during this incident was both \nwithin the law and SRPD policy. \n \nRecommendations: \n \n \n1. Early and immediate suspect control of the suspect will potentially limit the amount \nof force needed in an incident: \na. If an officer who is making a lawful detention and arrest is encountering a suspect \nwho is already resisting a control hold, using a more secure technique may result \nin an overall lower frequency and level of force used. Additionally, evaluation and \nreview of “contact and cover” concepts to utilize both officers to establish early \ncontrol of a suspect to prevent further resistance. The secondary officer should \nconsider assisting the primary officer with physical control to reduce the chances \nof resistance.  \n \n2. Implement increased and focused training on takedown techniques and control \nholds with attention to the environment of the incident: \na. The use of force was within law and policy, however, a number of techniques can \nbe reviewed and trained to decrease the potential for injury in cases such as these. \nWith earlier and better control of the arms and wrists, a number of techniques \nincluding arm bars and leg sweeps may be available to the officer. Training for \nthese situations and techniques would prevent an officer from lifting the suspect \nfrom the ground and taking them to the ground which has the potential for \nincreased injury to both the suspect and the officer.   \n \n3. Use of Force Review Board: \na. Discuss implementation of a Use of Force Review Board with the Professional \nStandards section of SRPD to create an additional layer of review to analyze \nincidents such as this for recommendations of actions.  Part of this review would \ninclude identifying ways to lessen injury to both community members and officers. \n \n4. After Action Review with involved officers: \na. Review the above findings and recommendations with Sgt Barrett, Officer Miller, \nand Officer Laron to improve effectiveness, improve officer safety, and reduce \ninjuries to both officers and members of the public.",

California Highway Patrol officers were pursuing Ayon who was actively fleeing in his\nvehicle and making his way towards the city of Salinas on Davis Road. I informed K9 Officer\nAnthony Garcia who had just arrived at the station for a second watch briefing of the request.\nOfficer Anthony Garcia left the station and Sergeant Roman advised he would be Officer\nGarcia’s cover officer. Officer Anthony Garcia headed towards the pursuit as it was coming into\nthe city and at West Alisal and Church Street, the California Highway Patrol turned over the\npursuit to Salinas Police.\n \nOfficer Anthony Garcia assumed the primary vehicle as he pursued Ayon and Sergeant Roman\nassumed the secondary pursuing unit. Officer Anthony Garcia attempted to conduct a Pursuit\nIntervention Technique (PIT) numerous times as he pursued Ayon. Officer Anthony Garcia\nattempted to conduct the PIT to stop Ayon and prevent any danger to the public. Each time\nOfficer Anthony Garcia attempted to PIT Ayon, Ayon would brake or maneuver his vehicle side\nto side to avoid a successful PIT by Officer Anthony Garcia. The pursuit was approximately 1.38\nmiles long and went throughout the southside of Salinas until a successful PIT was initiated by\nSergeant Roman in the area of Alameda Avenue and East Romie Lane.\n \nSergeant Roman took over as the primary pursuing vehicle in the area of Alameda Avenue just\nnorth of East Romie Lane after Officer Anthony Garcia was unsuccessful in conducting a PIT on\nAyon’s vehicle. Sergeant Roman was able to conduct a successful PIT on Ayon’s vehicle as they\nwere heading south on Alameda Avenue approaching East Romie Lane. The PIT caused Ayon’s\nvehicle to head into the driveway of \n East Romie Lane. Ayon then reversed his vehicle to\nflee, however Sergeant Roman was able to block his exit with his patrol vehicle. Ayon then\nstruck the patrol vehicle and drove forward back into the driveway of \n East Romie Lane. As\nAyon pulled into the driveway, Officer Anthony Garcia attempted to pin Ayon’s rear passenger\nquarter panel with his patrol vehicle’s push bumper to prevent Ayon from fleeing. Ayon again\nreversed out of the driveway and Sergeant Roman drove his patrol vehicle forward, making\ncontact with the rear-end of Ayon’s vehicle, to prevent him from fleeing.\n \nOfficer Anthony Garcia started to yell out verbal commands to Ayon to get on the ground and\nturn off the vehicle. Sergeant Roman exited his patrol vehicle and gave Ayon verbal commands\nto stop. Sergeant Roman pointed his department-issued firearm at Ayon while giving him\ncommands. Ayon refused to follow commands and he accelerated forward and was now further\ninto the driveway. Sergeant Roman then got back into the patrol vehicle and drove the patrol\nvehicle to pin the patrol vehicle against Ayon’s vehicle. As Sergeant Roman was getting in his\npatrol vehicle and sitting in the driver's seat, Ayon reversed at a fast rate and rammed into\nReport #\n23-100611\nUse of Force Report\nSalinas Police Department\nRelated Incident #\nPage 9 Of 11\nLEFTA Systems - 9483\nSergeant Roman’s patrol vehicle. Sergeant Roman’s driver door was still open when the\nramming occurred. Sergeant Roman then accelerated his patrol vehicle and pushed Ayon’s\nvehicle into the driveway and up on a wooden fence and lemon tree that was situated to the right\nof the driveway. A parked vehicle in the neighboring residence was in the driveway next to the\nfence and lemon tree, it appeared the fence and lemon tree rested on the vehicle parked in the\nneighboring driveway. This caused Ayon’s front end to be suspended up against the fence and\ntree.\n \nSeveral commands were given to Ayon to place his hands up and Ayon disobeyed commands\nand continued to reach around inside the vehicle. Ayon also repositioned the vehicle's mirrors to\nget a visual of Sergeant Roman who was situated behind him near the patrol vehicle. Ayon\nrefused commands for approximately 3 minutes and continued to reach around inside the\nvehicle. Officer Munoz arrived on scene and deployed the 40mm less-than-lethal kinetic\nprojectile launcher and deployed (4) foam baton rounds to break out the windows of Ayon’s\nvehicle. Officer Anthony Garcia then deployed K9 Bolt into the rear passenger windows to assist\nwith the apprehension of Ayon. K9 Bolt was able to assist with apprehending Ayon and officers\nimmediately approached the vehicle to assist with taking Ayon into custody and releasing K9\nBolt from him. Ayon suffered several K9 bite injuries to his upper right arm which required 35\nstaples and 2 sutures.\n \nDuring my interview with Ayon at Natividad Medical Center, Ayon advised he knew officers were\npursuing him and he panicked. Ayon stated he complied with placing his hands up when the\nofficers shot the window out. Ayon complained of pain in his neck, and he believed it was from\nthe collision. Ayon agreed if he could do it all over again, he would have pulled over right away\nand listened to the officer's commands. Ayon admitted to fleeing from the other pursuing agency\nbefore Salinas Police got involved. Witness \n provided videos to me as \n across\nthe street from where the pursuit was terminated. \n advised he could hear officers give\ncommands to the suspect several times during the incident.\n \nAyon presented life-threatening resistance by fleeing after committing an assault with a deadly\nweapon on an officer and continued to flee without due regard for the public as officers pursued\nhim. Ayon also rammed Sergeant Roman’s patrol vehicle while he was seated inside it. Officers\nattempted to de-escalate the situation by attempting to conduct PIT(s) numerous times. Officers\nalso attempted to de-escalate the situation after Ayon rammed Sergeant Roman’s vehicle with\nSergeant Roman sitting inside by using verbal commands to gain compliance. Ayon presented\nactive resistance by hiding his hands while inside the vehicle as officers commanded him to\nplace his hands up and stop reaching around the vehicle. The threats officers faced from Ayon\nwere his actions with his vehicle, the prior assault on the officer that led to the pursuit, and the\nrepositioning of his mirror in an attempt to get a visual of Sergeant Roman who was behind him.\nOfficers used intermediate force by deploying K9 Bolt into the vehicle after several minutes of\nverbal commands while attempting to gain compliance by placing his hands up.\n \nBased on the totality of the circumstances it is my opinion, that Sergeant Roman, Officer\nAnthony Garcia, and Officer Jeff Munoz used reasonable force during this incident and was\nwithin Salinas Police Policy.\nReport #\n23-100611\nUse of Force Report\nSalinas Police Department\nRelated Incident #\nPage 10 Of 11\nLEFTA Systems - 9483\nReviews\nName\nDate\nDiaz, Kimberly-75085\n02/26/2024, 11:22 PM\nMurray, John-59122\n02/27/2024, 7:16 AM\nBravo, Luis-10704\n02/27/2024, 8:35 AM\nSanchez, Ruben-76997\n02/26/2024, 6:24 PM\nReport #\n23-100611\nUse of Force Report\nSalinas Police Department\nRelated Incident #\nPage 11 Of 11\nLEFTA Systems - 9483",

One of the calls for service was from a \n, later identified as \n who observed the incident. \n relayed that \n had struck \n, and that \nReynaldo had attempted to stop her. \nDeputy Vander Horn #4602 and Deputy McGraw#3539 arrived on scene and contacted, \n, \nand Reynaldo. \nwas uncooperative with responding Deputies and refused to comply with their \ninstructions as they attempted to detain her.  \n \n intervened and put his arms around \n \nin attempt to keep Deputy Vander Horn from handcuffing her. \n then struck Deputy Vander Horn in the face with an open hand, when Deputy Vander Horn used \nforce against \n Reynaldo struck deputy Vander Horn with a closed fist. A struggle ensued as \ndeputies Vander Horn and McGraw attempted to take \n and Reynaldo into custody.  Deputy \nVander Horn requested \"Code cover\" and additional deputies responded to assist.

As I spoke with \n it appeared as if his right cheek had redness \nand he had a scratch behind his left ear. \n refused medical treatment; he was made aware of the \nEmergency Protective Order process but refused one and did not desire prosecution for his torn clothes. \nDeputy Rodriguez #0553 was able to establish a rapport with \nand obtained a partial statement, \nwhere \n admitted that when her and \n drink (referring to alcoholic beverages) \"things turn bad.\" \n went on to mention she was upset with \n and admits to essentially attacking him  by \"jumping \non him.\" See Deputy Rodriguez Deputy Report for details.  \n \nI met with Corporal Martinez, who advised me of the following during his interview with \n. \n \nstatement coincided with \n in the extent that the argument ensued, and \n struck \n first. \nSee Corporal Martinez' Report for details. I returned inside to search for the mentioned torn shirts \n \nspoke about and located a gray torn shirt on the floor near the couch.  \n \nBased on the totality of circumstances in relation to the Domestic Violence incident and the evidence \ndiscovered; I determined \n to be the dominant aggressor in violation of 273.5(a) PC. \n \nDeputy Vander Horn explained to me he used force on \n due to his unwillingness to comply with his \ninstructions. \n prevented Deputy Vander Horn from placing both\n and Reynaldo into handcuffs \nby blocking his movements and constantly approaching him while he was in an active fight with them. \nBased on the totality of the circumstances, I determined \n to be in violation of 148(a) PC - Obstruct \ndelay, peace officer. \n was Cited and Released on his written Notice to Appear (Cite #1085574).\n \ndid not require any medical attention and refused medical treatment. \n \nDue to Reynaldo's assaultive behavior where he punched Deputy Vander Horn in the face, I determined \nhe was in violation of 69(a) PC and 243(c)(2) PC. Prior to booking Reynaldo was transported to Sharp \nGrossmont where he was treated for a broken left elbow.

Based on my investigation, I determined \n was \nin violation of 273.5 (a) PC, 243(c)(2) PC, and 69(a) PC. Prior to booking, I transported her to Alvarado \nHospital for further medical treatment and medical clearance. Once at Alvarado Hospital, \n was \nuncooperative with medical staff, where she refused to answer their medical questions, she refused to \nstand or sit still during an assessment of her blood pressure and other vital assessments. \n advised \nme that her anxiety was very high and demanded I transport her to jail.  \n \nI attempted to de-escalate \n by speaking to her calmly and requested she \"calm down\" and \nattempted to coach her through breathing techniques, but she remained anxious and told me something \nto the extent of, \"Take me now or I'm going to do something really dumb.\" Due to \n previous \nassaultive behavior and unwillingness to comply with Deputies instructions, I advised \n to stand still \nand not walk away from me. \n refused to comply with my instructions and would pace back and \nforth. I would place my hand on her right arm and remind her, \"please. Do not walk away from me or I will \nuse force.\" \n demanded I release her and not touch her and dropped her weight at one point. I \nallowed for \n to sit on the floor. I called Sgt. Bravo and notified him of \n further unwillingness \nto cooperate and requested he send me an additional partner. Alvarado medical staff then handed me \n medical clearance paperwork and advised me \nwas medically cleared for booking.  \n once again stood up and began to walk away from me, despite my warning for her to not walk \naway from me. As \n tried to walk past me, I grabbed her by her right arm and pushed her into a \nnearby wall and told her to \"stop walking away from me.\"  \n \nHad I not used this additional force, \n could have attempted to walk away from me to escape. I \neventually gained slight cooperation from \n when Hospital Staff brought her a pair of socks which I \nassisted her in putting them on. \n agreed to walk outside and to my patrol vehicle to be transported \nto the Las Colinas Detention Re-Entry Facility (LCDRF). As we walked to my patrol vehicle, she once \nagain stopped and refused to proceed to my patrol vehicle. At this point Deputy Rodriguez #0553 arrived \nand was able to transport \nto LCDRF.   \n \n was eventually booked into LCDRF for 273.5(a) PC, 243(C)(2) PC, and 69(a) PC without further \nincident and should also be charged with 148(d) PC.   \n \nPhotographs of Deputy Vander Horn, Deputy McGraw, \nl, \n, Reynaldo and their injuries were \ntaken.

One of the calls for service was from a \n, later identified as \n, who observed the incident. \n relayed that \n had struck \n, and that \nReynaldo had attempted to stop her.  \n \nDeputy Vander Horn #4602 and Deputy McGraw#3539 arrived on scene and contacted, \n \n \nand Reynaldo. \n was uncooperative with responding Deputies and refused to comply with their \ninstructions as they attempted to detain her.  \n \n intervened and put his arms around \n \nin attempt to keep Deputy Vander Horn from handcuffing her. \n \nthen struck Deputy Vander Horn in the face with an open hand, when Deputy Vander Horn used \nforce against \n, Reynaldo struck deputy Vander Horn with a closed fist. A struggle ensued as \ndeputies Vander Horn and McGraw attempted to take \nl and Reynaldo into custody.  Deputy \nVander Horn requested \"Code cover\" and additional deputies responded to assist. Force was used to \ndetain \n, Reynaldo, and \n During the struggle, \n grabbed onto Deputy Vander Horn's \ndepartment issued firearm handle, which is in violation of 148 (d) PC.  \n \nCorporal Martinez #0430 and I arrived on scene and observed Deputy McGraw actively fighting \n \non the floor inside the residence.

Deputy McGraw used her CED to drive stun \n but it was ineffective. I \nwas able to force \n onto her stomach by repositioning my hands to her left upper arm and shoulder \nand push her body forward. In doing so, I lost hold of \n left arm, and she tucked it under her body, \nthus refusing to cooperate. I placed my flashlight in the crux of her left arm and applied upward pressure, \nprying her left arm out from underneath her body and was able to place her into handcuffs.  \n \nThe force used was necessary and had I not used force \n could have attempted to escape from my \ncustody and further assault other deputies. Deputy Vander Horn suffered pain to his jaw, two scratches \nto his face, and pain to his right elbow. Deputy McGraw suffered an injury to her left hand. Deputy \nVander Horn and Deputy McGraw went to Kaiser Hospital for further medical evaluations and treatment. \nKaiser Hospital staff advised Deputy McGraw's left thumb was sprained and may be broken, the severity \nof the injury will be assessed in upcoming medical appointments.

I returned inside to search for the mentioned torn shirts \n \nspoke about and located a gray torn shirt on the floor near the couch.  \n \nBased on the totality of circumstances in relation to the Domestic Violence incident and the evidence \ndiscovered; I determined \n to be the dominant aggressor in violation of 273.5(a) PC. \n \nDeputy Vander Horn explained to me he used force on \n due to his unwillingness to comply with his \ninstructions. \n prevented Deputy Vander Horn from placing both \nand Reynaldo into handcuffs \nby blocking his movements and constantly approaching him while he was in an active fight with them. \nBased on the totality of the circumstances, I determined \n to be in violation of 148(a) PC - Obstruct \ndelay, peace officer. \n was Cited and Released on his written Notice to Appear (Cite #1085574). \n \ndid not require any medical attention and refused medical treatment. \n \nDue to Reynaldo's assaultive behavior where he punched Deputy Vander Horn in the face, I determined \nhe was in violation of 69(a) PC and 243(c)(2) PC. Prior to booking Reynaldo was transported to Sharp \nGrossmont where he was treated for a broken left elbow. Reynaldo was eventually transported and \nbooked into the San Diego Central Jail for 243(C)(2) PC and 69(a) PC.   \n \ndemanded medical treatment, but she was uncooperative with paramedics when they arrived and \nattempted to evaluate her for any injuries sustained. Based on my investigation, I determined \n was \nin violation of 273.5 (a) PC, 243(c)(2) PC, and 69(a) PC. Prior to booking, I transported her to Alvarado \nHospital for further medical treatment and medical clearance. Once at Alvarado Hospital, \n was \nuncooperative with medical staff, where she refused to answer their medical questions, she refused to \nstand or sit still during an assessment of her blood pressure and other vital assessments. \n advised \nme that her anxiety was very high and demanded I transport her to jail.  \n \nI attempted to de-escalate \n by speaking to her calmly and requested she \"calm down\" and \nattempted to coach her through breathing techniques, but she remained anxious and told me something \nto the extent of, \"Take me now or I'm going to do something really dumb.\" Due to \n previous \n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n-\n-\n-\n--\n-\n-\n1 1 \n-\n--\n-\n-\n(b)(6)(D)\n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nPublic Records Request \nVictim Copy \n7 \nPage 7 of 8 \n \n \nCase No. 23135223 \nPrimary Victim: \nVander Horn, Deputy \nReport No. 23135223.1 \n \n \nReporting Officer \nDivision / Organization \n \nSH7767 - BONIFACIO JR, FERNANDO \nRancho San Diego Station \nRANCHO SAN DIEGO PATROL \n \nReport Date \nDetective Assigned \n \n08/19/2023 23:31:52 \n \n \n \nNetRMS_CASDCR rtf v11-15-06 \n \nPrinted By SH5865 \nPrinted: September 20, 2023 - 1:36 PM \n \nassaultive behavior and unwillingness to comply with Deputies instructions, I advised \n to stand still \nand not walk away from me. \n refused to comply with my instructions and would pace back and \nforth. I would place my hand on her right arm and remind her, \"please. Do not walk away from me or I will \nuse force.\" \n demanded I release her and not touch her and dropped her weight at one point. I \nallowed for \n to sit on the floor. I called Sgt. Bravo and notified him of \n further unwillingness \nto cooperate and requested he send me an additional partner. Alvarado medical staff then handed me \n medical clearance paperwork and advised me \n was medically cleared for booking.  \n once again stood up and began to walk away from me, despite my warning for her to not walk \naway from me. As \n tried to walk past me, I grabbed her by her right arm and pushed her into a \nnearby wall and told her to \"stop walking away from me.\"  \n \nHad I not used this additional force, \n could have attempted to walk away from me to escape. I \neventually gained slight cooperation from \n when Hospital Staff brought her a pair of socks which I \nassisted her in putting them on. \n agreed to walk outside and to my patrol vehicle to be transported \nto the Las Colinas Detention Re-Entry Facility (LCDRF). As we walked to my patrol vehicle, she once \nagain stopped and refused to proceed to my patrol vehicle. At this point Deputy Rodriguez #0553 arrived \nand was able to transport \n to LCDRF.   \n \n was eventually booked into LCDRF for 273.5(a) PC, 243(C)(2) PC, and 69(a) PC without further \nincident and should also be charged with 148(d) PC.   \n \nPhotographs of Deputy Vander Horn, Deputy McGraw, \n \n, Reynaldo and their injuries were \ntaken.

As a result of my use of force Reynaldo was successfully detained in handcuffs. I feared had I not used force \nagainst Reynaldo may have caused additional harm to me and prevented deputies from placing \nunder arrest for her \nbattery against me, and from investigating the domestic violence incident that had just occurred. \n \nI turned to \n, who had been in an active fight with Deputy McGraw since Reynaldo had struck me. Deputy McGraw and \n were on the ground, and Deputy McGraw was attempting to place \n in handcuffs, but she was actively resisting \nby pulling her arms and hands away, while using her body weight to avoid being controlled. I grabbed onto \n left arm \nwith my right hand and pulled it behind her back. As Deputy McGraw and I moved \n onto her stomach and her hands \nwere behind her back, \n began to approach me from behind and said, \"That's enough\". I removed my department issued \nConductive Elective Device (CED) and pointed it at \n I ordered \n to back away from us. Deputy McGraw nearly had \n in handcuffs, when she kicked out and was able to continue to fight with us. \n actions of approaching and verbally \ninterfering with our lawful detention of \ndisrupted our duties and prevented us from successfully detaining her. Had I not \nneeded to move my attention from \n to \n, and shift my body weight to defend against \n encroachment, then \n would not have been able to pull herself from our grasp and continued to fight deputies. \n \nDeputy McGraw and I remained stationary with me pointing my CED at \nand Deputy McGraw in an active fight with \n until additional deputies arrived. Deputy Feistel arrived on scene, and I assisted him in detaining \n into handcuffs. \nAdditional deputies assisted McGraw in detaining \n \n \n actions that necessitated my use of force against her were her striking me in the face, her grabbing my firearm while \nI was detaining Reynaldo, and her active resistance of attempts to be detained while on the ground. The result of my use of \nforce was\n ultimately being detained. I feared that had I not used force, that \n would have continued to harm me \nor Deputy McGraw or possibly been able to escape and evade arrest. \n \naction that necessitated my use of force was his interference in the detention of Reynaldo and \nl. I feared that had \nI not used force against \n that he would have interfered with the arrest of \n, potentially causing harm to myself or \nDeputy McGraw. The result of my use of force was preventing \n from interfering with the arrest of \n and his \ndetention. \n \nDuring this incident I suffered a scratch underneath my left nostril, a scratch to my right cheek, pain to my jaw, and pain to my \nright elbow. \n \nThe above incident was captured on Body Worn Camera. \n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b)(6)(B)\n(b) 6)(B)\n-\n-\n- r1 -\n-\n-\n1 1 \n-\n(b)(6)(D)\n \nSan Diego County Sheriff's Department \nUse of Force Supplemental \n \n \n    \n(Revised 5/17/13 NetRMS) \n \nPrinted By SH5865 \nPrinted: September 20, 2023 - 1:37 PM \n \nUFO DATE AND TIME \nEVENT NUMBER \nCASE NUMBER \nDOCUMENT NUMBER \nSTATION/FACILITY \n8/19/2023 21:21 \nE8730576 \n23135223 \n142648 \nRSD - Rancho San Diego Station \nINCIDENT DESCRIPTION / OFFENSES \nAR//273.5PC, 69PC, 69PC \n/69PC 243(c)(2) R.

I then removed my \nConductive Energy Device (Taser) from my duty holster and pointed it at \n and gave him verbal commands to \"Get the \nfuck on the ground.\" \n immediately complied and laid face down in the living room. I holstered my taser and handcuffed \n without incident.        \n \nDeputies were able to finally detain \n in handcuffs. Deputies were giving \n verbal commands to stop kicking \nat them. I then advised Deputy Martinez that we needed to escort \n out of the residence. I assisted \n to her \nfeet and due to her assaultive behavior, I placed her in a hammer lock control hold to better control her movements as we \nescorted her to the patrol vehicle. I placed my left arm under \n right forearm and placed my left hand on her right \nshoulder. I gave \n verbal commands to walk as I escorted her out of the residence in a hammer lock control hold. \n told me, \"No\" when I told her to walk and tried to drop her weight. I gave \n more verbal commands to keep \nwalking.  \n \n reluctantly complied as she continued to request for a supervisor to come to the scene. As I was placing \n \ninto the back of the patrol vehicle I gave her commands to get into the car. As \nsat in the vehicle she placed her feet \noutside of the vehicle preventing us from closing the car door. Due to \n assaultive behavior I feared she may try kick \nus If we tried to place her legs into the vehicle. I then used both of my hands to push \n on her upper chest to get her \nfeet into the vehicle so we could close the car door. \n resisted and continued to place her feet outside of the vehicle \npreventing us from closing the car door. I again tried pushing \n to get her feet inside of the vehicle and again she \nresisted. \n had to be pulled from behind by other deputies to get her secured safely in the back of the patrol vehicle.      \n \nHad I not pointed my taser at \n he may have tried to intervene and tried to assault me or one of my partners. Had I not \nused a hammer lock control hold to escort \n to the patrol vehicle she may have been able to turn on me while we \nescorted her and try and assault me or one of my partners. No injuries were sustained from the forced I used on \n and \n.

California Highway Patrol officers were pursuing Ayon who was actively fleeing in his\nvehicle and making his way towards the city of Salinas on Davis Road. I informed K9 Officer\nAnthony Garcia who had just arrived at the station for a second watch briefing of the request.\nOfficer Anthony Garcia left the station and Sergeant Roman advised he would be Officer\nGarcia’s cover officer. Officer Anthony Garcia headed towards the pursuit as it was coming into\nthe city and at West Alisal and Church Street, the California Highway Patrol turned over the\npursuit to Salinas Police.\n \nOfficer Anthony Garcia assumed the primary vehicle as he pursued Ayon and Sergeant Roman\nassumed the secondary pursuing unit. Officer Anthony Garcia attempted to conduct a Pursuit\nIntervention Technique (PIT) numerous times as he pursued Ayon. Officer Anthony Garcia\nattempted to conduct the PIT to stop Ayon and prevent any danger to the public. Each time\nOfficer Anthony Garcia attempted to PIT Ayon, Ayon would brake or maneuver his vehicle side\nto side to avoid a successful PIT by Officer Anthony Garcia. The pursuit was approximately 1.38\nmiles long and went throughout the southside of Salinas until a successful PIT was initiated by\nSergeant Roman in the area of Alameda Avenue and East Romie Lane.\n \nSergeant Roman took over as the primary pursuing vehicle in the area of Alameda Avenue just\nnorth of East Romie Lane after Officer Anthony Garcia was unsuccessful in conducting a PIT on\nAyon’s vehicle. Sergeant Roman was able to conduct a successful PIT on Ayon’s vehicle as they\nwere heading south on Alameda Avenue approaching East Romie Lane. The PIT caused Ayon’s\nvehicle to head into the driveway of \n East Romie Lane. Ayon then reversed his vehicle to\nflee, however Sergeant Roman was able to block his exit with his patrol vehicle. Ayon then\nstruck the patrol vehicle and drove forward back into the driveway of \n East Romie Lane. As\nAyon pulled into the driveway, Officer Anthony Garcia attempted to pin Ayon’s rear passenger\nquarter panel with his patrol vehicle’s push bumper to prevent Ayon from fleeing. Ayon again\nreversed out of the driveway and Sergeant Roman drove his patrol vehicle forward, making\ncontact with the rear-end of Ayon’s vehicle, to prevent him from fleeing.\n \nOfficer Anthony Garcia started to yell out verbal commands to Ayon to get on the ground and\nturn off the vehicle. Sergeant Roman exited his patrol vehicle and gave Ayon verbal commands\nto stop. Sergeant Roman pointed his department-issued firearm at Ayon while giving him\ncommands. Ayon refused to follow commands and he accelerated forward and was now further\ninto the driveway. Sergeant Roman then got back into the patrol vehicle and drove the patrol\nvehicle to pin the patrol vehicle against Ayon’s vehicle. As Sergeant Roman was getting in his\npatrol vehicle and sitting in the driver's seat, Ayon reversed at a fast rate and rammed into\nReport #\n23-100611\nUse of Force Report\nSalinas Police Department\nRelated Incident #\nPage 9 Of 11\nLEFTA Systems - 9483\nSergeant Roman’s patrol vehicle. Sergeant Roman’s driver door was still open when the\nramming occurred. Sergeant Roman then accelerated his patrol vehicle and pushed Ayon’s\nvehicle into the driveway and up on a wooden fence and lemon tree that was situated to the right\nof the driveway. A parked vehicle in the neighboring residence was in the driveway next to the\nfence and lemon tree, it appeared the fence and lemon tree rested on the vehicle parked in the\nneighboring driveway. This caused Ayon’s front end to be suspended up against the fence and\ntree.\n \nSeveral commands were given to Ayon to place his hands up and Ayon disobeyed commands\nand continued to reach around inside the vehicle. Ayon also repositioned the vehicle's mirrors to\nget a visual of Sergeant Roman who was situated behind him near the patrol vehicle. Ayon\nrefused commands for approximately 3 minutes and continued to reach around inside the\nvehicle. Officer Munoz arrived on scene and deployed the 40mm less-than-lethal kinetic\nprojectile launcher and deployed (4) foam baton rounds to break out the windows of Ayon’s\nvehicle. Officer Anthony Garcia then deployed K9 Bolt into the rear passenger windows to assist\nwith the apprehension of Ayon. K9 Bolt was able to assist with apprehending Ayon and officers\nimmediately approached the vehicle to assist with taking Ayon into custody and releasing K9\nBolt from him. Ayon suffered several K9 bite injuries to his upper right arm which required 35\nstaples and 2 sutures.\n \nDuring my interview with Ayon at Natividad Medical Center, Ayon advised he knew officers were\npursuing him and he panicked. Ayon stated he complied with placing his hands up when the\nofficers shot the window out. Ayon complained of pain in his neck, and he believed it was from\nthe collision. Ayon agreed if he could do it all over again, he would have pulled over right away\nand listened to the officer's commands. Ayon admitted to fleeing from the other pursuing agency\nbefore Salinas Police got involved. Witness \n provided videos to me as \n across\nthe street from where the pursuit was terminated. \n advised he could hear officers give\ncommands to the suspect several times during the incident.\n \nAyon presented life-threatening resistance by fleeing after committing an assault with a deadly\nweapon on an officer and continued to flee without due regard for the public as officers pursued\nhim. Ayon also rammed Sergeant Roman’s patrol vehicle while he was seated inside it. Officers\nattempted to de-escalate the situation by attempting to conduct PIT(s) numerous times. Officers\nalso attempted to de-escalate the situation after Ayon rammed Sergeant Roman’s vehicle with\nSergeant Roman sitting inside by using verbal commands to gain compliance. Ayon presented\nactive resistance by hiding his hands while inside the vehicle as officers commanded him to\nplace his hands up and stop reaching around the vehicle. The threats officers faced from Ayon\nwere his actions with his vehicle, the prior assault on the officer that led to the pursuit, and the\nrepositioning of his mirror in an attempt to get a visual of Sergeant Roman who was behind him.\nOfficers used intermediate force by deploying K9 Bolt into the vehicle after several minutes of\nverbal commands while attempting to gain compliance by placing his hands up.\n \nBased on the totality of the circumstances it is my opinion, that Sergeant Roman, Officer\nAnthony Garcia, and Officer Jeff Munoz used reasonable force during this incident and was\nwithin Salinas Police Policy.\nReport #\n23-100611\nUse of Force Report\nSalinas Police Department\nRelated Incident #\nPage 10 Of 11\nLEFTA Systems - 9483\nReviews\nName\nDate\nDiaz, Kimberly-75085\n02/26/2024, 11:22 PM\nMurray, John-59122\n02/27/2024, 7:16 AM\nBravo, Luis-10704\n02/27/2024, 8:35 AM\nSanchez, Ruben-76997\n02/26/2024, 6:24 PM\nReport #\n23-100611\nUse of Force Report\nSalinas Police Department\nRelated Incident #\nPage 11 Of 11\nLEFTA Systems - 9483",
